00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The average coffee producer has a very tiny farm.


00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It's very common here for producers to have about a hectare,


00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
hectare and a half of coffee farming land.


00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And these are just some statistics taken from the FNC website,


00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the Tecumseh Nacional de Cafe,


00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to give you an idea of how many cherries per hectare you can get


00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in exportable bags and then the typical varieties that we have here in Colombia.


00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.400
TÃ­pica, Bufo, Maripojipe, Tabi, and then Artura Castillo is what we have, what we're processing right now.


00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.800
This is also to show you, I love this picture, it's taken from here, it's from taken up close to our


00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:49.400
house, to see the steepness of the mountain, the terrain is incredibly steep, so it's really hard


00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.800
to mechanize. All of the work has to be done by hand, and you can see little patchwork quilts of


00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.080
all of this, you know, tiny little farms owned by completely different owners. It's a very


00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.520
parceled landscape.


00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:13.880
This is some more information about a typical producer. So again, a little less than one and


00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.840
a half hectares. How much that cherry, about how much that cherry would, how much cherry that


00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.480
amount of land would give you. This is about the price right now. So we were talking about this


00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.480
We bought it about 85 cents per kilo of cherry.


00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.480
And then you can also see the price of green coffee.


00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.480
But what's interesting about these statistics too is that the price of fertilizer is almost half of your cost.


00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.480
Fertilizer is incredibly expensive and it's a huge, huge input for coffee producers.


00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:54.480
producers. And, okay, so here, so your annual income from that amount of land would be about


00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.480
$9,000 per year, which is not very much when half of your cost is going to, going to fertilizer


00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:08.480
and then also, one of the things that's a little fuzzy too is that the most expensive


00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.480
thing for coffee production is labor. And when you have these really small farms, well,


00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.480
So you usually have your wife and you have your kids and you have a lot of family members.


00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.480
So it's a lot of undocumented labor, a lot of unaccounted for labor.


00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.480
So you don't really have a good idea of how much it costs to produce coffee


00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.480
because a lot of people don't know how to value their time or they don't know how to account for their time.


00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.480
So it's just something to keep in mind.


00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.480
And the other thing we were talking about is a typical producer, a typical picker, sorry,


00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.400
can make about maybe $10 to $20 per day picking coffee,


00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.160
depending on how-- the variety and how charged,


00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.160
meaning how much cherry there is on a particular tree.


00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.840
So it's very little.


00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.040
Just thinking about how much actually


00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.000
makes it back to the producer and then actually


00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.120
makes it back to the baker compared to our coffee prices,


00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.560
just to give some context.


00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.280
So I was wondering if either Matt or Caleb


00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.040
wants to share any statistics about Thailand,


00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.080
about how different it is there, any similarities?


00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.240
Not to put you on the spot.


00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.880
It's just kind of a time to share.


00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.640
Yeah, it is mostly small farms.


00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:35.280
OK, yeah.


00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.200
It's mostly very, I think even smaller farms than that.


00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.840
Like in the area where we are,


00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.000
the average farm is about two, 3,000 trees.


00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.900
And,


00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.080
fertilizer isn't nearly that much


00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.100
because a lot of people, what they'll do


00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.580
is they'll raise pigs and then just use the pig manure


00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.500
for the fertilizer.


00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.180
So like, they'll have a coffee farm


00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.180
And then up, like at the top of the dovetail side,


00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.980
they'll have their pigs and then the fertilizer


00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.300
is easy to just distribute down.


00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.300
So, let's see, this year the cherry price


00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.820
went up quite a bit.


00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.820
It's over a dollar, maybe about $1.20, $1.30 a kilo


00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.180
So it's usually around, it's usually less than a dollar, but it went up a lot this year.


00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.180
So other statistics seem pretty similar.


00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.180
So the reality of coffee farmers here is very similar to the reality that you're used to.


00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.180
Julie, do you want to share?


00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.180
Sure.


00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.180
Very different.


00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.180
Do you mind coming up?


00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.180
Yeah.


00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:59.180
So in Hawaii, labor is very, very competitive.


00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.180
For ag laborers, you're at least looking at your standard minimum wage.


00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.180
In Hawaii, it's $10.10 right now per hour.


00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:13.180
So a lot of farmers prefer to pay their pickers by weight.


00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.180
So they'll offer a price per pound in cherry weight,


00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.180
and actually that can be even better for some pickers


00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.140
pickers because they can make way above minimum wage if they're very good at


00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:30.460
picking. So in that situation pretty much everyone wins. Cherries come off the tree.


00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.600
There's usually a fair amount of sorting. Right now it's a very high competition


00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.300
for cherry with the recent introduction of Calpamulipras, Roya, and I believe I


00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:47.020
heard that the farmers or buyers for cherry are paying probably around five


00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.220
dollars per kilo for raw cherry. So pretty high.


00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.660
Yeah. So I get that question a lot. Why is, because we know that Hawaii coffee has,


00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.020
it's very expensive or much more expensive than coffee from Guatemala or Honduras.


00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.100
So people say, or they ask, is it 15 times better than coffee from somewhere else?


00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.380
Is it actually that much better? No, it's good coffee, but the labor is a


00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.660
a completely different animal.


00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.960
Paying somebody $10 an hour, paying somebody $10


00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.860
for a whole day, that multiplied makes a big difference.


00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.260
Cecil, do you have anything to add about the makeup?


00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:34.740
Just a touch on the picket.


00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.580
We tried jaw picking.


00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.500
It doesn't work.


00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.500
It's a super challenge to monitor the pickers.


00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.500
They go from this tree to that tree to that tree.


00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.500
They strip the trees.


00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.500
They break off the branches.


00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.500
They come down with coffee that looks more green than red


00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.500
just to make up for it.


00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.500
You don't have a strong culture of picking.


00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.500
It's more...


00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.500
I just took out some pickers down.


00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:16.500
For a 30 kilo box unit, you get $67 at the gate.


00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:23.500
If you were to process that, you'd get upwards of $320 for the same amount.


00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.500
A bag of fertilizer is $100.


00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:35.500
So that comes out, and the labor is usually around $20 a day to $25 a day.


00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:43.500
So when you have the leave on the fertilizer and the cut, but you can't pick dry, it's difficult.


00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:50.500
So it's better you have slow pickers that pick properly.


00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:56.500
But look at that. So I would say that Blue Mountain Coffee is on par with Kona Coffee,


00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:02.100
and yet you're still paying very similar labor prices to some places like Colombia, $20 a day


00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:09.700
versus $200 a day. That's interesting. This is $20 a day. Yeah, $20 a day.


00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:18.820
Something else that's very unique in Colombia is that because there's so many regions and


00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:24.660
the difference in altitude, somewhere there will be cherries all year round. I guess there's like


00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:30.020
a little pocket in August where there's no coffee but 11 months of the year somewhere in Colombia


00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:37.460
coffee's coming in and so that has a lot of advantages in terms of making you know coffee


00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.980
really important for the economy that it's kind of this constantly moving machine. One of the


00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.620
disadvantages oh well and you can see this picture I really like because you can see you have red


00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.780
cherries you have green and you have flowering all at the same time so you have this like cycle


00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:58.260
which makes it very hard for quality because you do need more skilled pickers because you have this


00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:05.380
variation. And if you're not skilled, your those flowers are really easy to not grow. So you can be


00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:10.020
picking and kind of ruining the next season's crop because you're trying to do these things at the


00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:15.780
same time. So that makes that's very much a challenge. Another challenge I've noticed of


00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:22.020
this kind of rhythm is that there's very little downtime. And so a lot of the producers when I


00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.100
work in Guatemala, when I work in Honduras, when I work in other places that have like a definite


00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:31.060
harvest season, there is the off time where you can make investments, where you can make improvements,


00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.820
where you can do maintenance. But in a lot of these places, maintenance and improvements are


00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.140
really on the back burner because there's not a lot of time to catch up. There's just a lot of coffee


00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.300
most of the year. So that's just something to keep in mind as well.


00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:57.300
This is another thing just to keep talking about this context of picking is about half of the cost of the production of coffee


00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.300
and fertilizer is another quarter so it's really significant.


00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:08.300
There's not a lot of margin left and what we saw from the other slide as well is that it's very difficult to make a living.


00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:14.300
So coffee producers in Colombia very rarely, they can't really make a living from coffee only.


00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:19.340
have to have other crops, they've got to have other inputs, because coffee in and of itself


00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:25.660
is a very difficult way to make a living. And one of the things that we were talking about here


00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:33.260
in the Spanish group with Valeria and Alejandra, as they were saying, because of the troubles in


00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.580
Brazil this year, the price of cherry went up really high, a lot of producers got really excited


00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:42.380
that the cherry price went up, but also the fertilizer price went up, and then by the time


00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:47.660
a lot of producers got around to planting their more coffee because they were excited about the


00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.260
second.


00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.460
The first FTC we tried to record it because a lot of people, it was still closer to COVID,


00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.900
so a lot of people wanted to have like a digital version to make it watch because they couldn't


00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:21.100
travel. So we tried to film a lot of this and it was just with the dogs barking and the motorcycles


00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:27.260
and the traffic it didn't work out. But anyway, so what they were commenting on was that the


00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:31.740
price of cherry went up, a lot of producers were planting more coffee, and now the price of cherry


00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.900
has come down, it's more destabilized, the Colombian peso has been devalued against a dollar


00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:41.340
a lot, but the price of fertilizer didn't come down also. So the price of fertilizer stayed really


00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:48.220
high, but the cherries come down and it's just kind of like cannibalizing cycle that is a really


00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:53.260
unfortunate like pattern that doesn't seem to be breaking. So something to keep in mind as well.


00:11:53.260 --> 00:12:03.900
This is also to think about the view of like specialty coffee or these beautiful beneficios.


00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.780
So, Renata was asking me about Diego,


00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.940
and he's got one of the most beautiful beneficios.


00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:13.940
It's very, very showy and very technologically advanced.


00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.420
And I think that gives a lot of consumers


00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.340
a skewed vision of Colombia.


00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.420
I think that is a very unicorn,


00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.940
half of a one percenter who can do that.


00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.780
Most, this down here, the most,


00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.380
for these small producers, that's what you've got.


00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.300
That's a turd refrigerator that they're using as a thing.


00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:37.580
Like, it's a lot of really small producers that process their own cherry into cold coffee


00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.900
and either sell it wet or try to dry it and then sell it that way.


00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:49.660
So it's really about speed and just getting to the final product so that you can get some


00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.940
money.


00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.980
In specialty, there are some improvements.


00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.620
This is the mill that I worked at when I met Ceo Estienne.


00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:02.500
So at least it's indoors and it's, you know, tiled instead of this outdoor kind of random


00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.500
pulper.


00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.500
What else?


00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.500
That's all I want to say about this.


00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.460
I just wanted to give you that kind of context that most of the producers are really small


00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:16.980
and most of the producers are just kind of DIY with very old equipment.


00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:26.060
And that what you see in these beautiful pictures is the exception, not the rule of coffee production.


00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:31.500
The other thing I find fascinating is that even though there are 33 co-ops and 530 buying


00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:37.860
stations, there's really only three dry mills in the country, in like all of Colombia.


00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.340
And so all of this coffee gets funneled into these like three points.


00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.740
So you can think about all those half a million producers and all of that coffee and all those


00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:50.780
tiny lots really getting funneled into these three outlets.


00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:57.340
And so that also creates a lot of difficulty in the specialty coffee industry because a


00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:02.220
lot of coffees get blended, maybe not on purpose, maybe some on purpose, but it's really difficult


00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:07.140
to have that traceability, especially on smaller lots, because you send something in and you're


00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:12.580
not sure where it went and if the coffee you get back is the coffee that you gave them.


00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:19.060
It's a really big barrier for a lot of producers to kind of try and find that outside market.


00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:27.340
So there's a lot of ways in which the FNC is helpful in terms of controlling and supporting


00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:31.940
the coffee industry, and there's still a lot of ways that it's kind of, like I said, cannibalizing


00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:37.340
and really getting in its way, I think, long term.


00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.380
Just really thinking about the long term sustainability.


00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.380
It's very short term.


00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:46.140
It's very like, all right, let's just get through this week and get through this month,


00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.740
and not really thinking about the long-term viability of the industry.


00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.840
Yes.


00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:59.420
So this is specific to what we're working on.


00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.340
So these are the numbers for FTC2.


00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.460
So we got 450 kilos of cherry.


00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.420
Today we actually got like 500, so we got a little bit more cherry.


00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:13.500
So here you can see how much our yield is going to be.


00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:20.440
So the reason I wanted to include this for non-coffee producers is to have an idea of how much coffee actually


00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.020
how much cherry it takes to make a little bit of coffee.


00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:29.060
So all of that work, all of those hours of us sorting and all the work that we're gonna do this week and then the


00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.640
hopefully not but potentially weeks of drying.


00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.260
At the end we're gonna get one bag, one 60 kilo bag


00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:46.060
of coffee, of green coffee. So there's a lot of waste in this product. There's a lot of coffee that goes,


00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:51.060
a lot of parts of the coffee that go unused. It takes a lot of coffee to make a little bit of coffee.


00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:58.340
And so you're just some of the, if we, this is like what we spent in Cherry, that's how much we


00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:04.740
bought it for, and if we were able to dry it and sell it dry, we could make a little bit more. And


00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.540
And then again, if we sold it in the specialty market, maybe we could get that much.


00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.540
So it sort of seems like pretty viable.


00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:15.140
Like our cherry price to our sale price, maybe it could be a business.


00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.540
But that doesn't count again, cutting it in half for the fertilizer and then the labor


00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:24.040
and everything that goes into actually producing this cup of coffee.


00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.040
This is just kind of numbers.


00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.040
So it's a difficult game.


00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:34.360
And so the other thing is showing here is that for we need five and a half, 5.5 kilos of cherry


00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.600
to come up with one kilo of exportable coffee.


00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.140
So that's after we've sorted out all the floaters, after we sorted out all the insects, all the greens that you guys have taken out.


00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.660
And then even then as we continue to dry, there'll be more things taken out.


00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.980
There's many steps where we keep kind of polishing the coffee.


00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:55.000
So it takes a lot of coffee and then there's again, most of it is waste.


00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.720
is the pulp, is the mucilage, is the parchment, is the silverskin. There's a lot of parts that go


00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:05.400
that we don't use. So I think about this a lot when people say, "Well, we should pay more for coffee."


00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.520
And absolutely true, we should pay more for coffee. But there's all of these other parts of coffee


00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.200
that we're not using. I wonder if there's like something that we can do for the four-fifths that


00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:19.480
we throw away instead of saying, "Well, let's just pay for that one-fifth more. Let's do both. Let's


00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.880
pay more for that one-fifth and let's do something with those four-fifths." So I've seen some companies


00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:31.320
that are making like coffee flours, like flour like to make cookies and goods, to try and buy


00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:37.560
some of that cascara. I know the parchment can be used as a fuel, people burn it, but I still feel


00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.400
like there's not enough innovation in this part of the industry. There's not enough people that


00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:47.800
are trying to do something with this. We're just sort of accepting all of this waste and yeah.


00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:57.640
Just to give you an idea of, you know, most of the producers and the exporters know these statistics,


00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.840
that Columbia is the third largest producer in the world.


00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.840
What I find interesting about this is that, well, Vietnam is mostly Robusta.


00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:11.840
So when we're talking about Arabica, Columbia really is number two in terms of world production and the importance of it.


00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.640
So when you think about in the world, most of our coffee is coming from these two countries,


00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:22.400
And in the world, like the coffee that's coming, these producers are not able to make a living


00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.760
because they have such small plots and the prices are so poor and the fertilizer is so


00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:31.800
expensive and we just, and then there's no, there's no, there's no answers to this.


00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.840
It's just like, okay, we're just going to like keep going until like the wheels fall


00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.840
off I feel like and then we'll like figure it out then.


00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.840
I don't know.


00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:45.640
It's just, you know, it's a really frustrating part of the industry because there's so much


00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:50.920
that we love about coffee and this is important for me for like the context of the event.


00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:56.120
Like there's all of these beautiful parts that we get to share and I just feel like we don't,


00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.760
we like that balance is not there. We're not talking enough about the sustainability of like


00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.840
the lives of the people making the coffee. We're like oh sustainability of the forest and making


00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:09.640
sure that we have shade trees. Like but what about the people? There's, it's not sustainable for the


00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:15.080
people and that's not even talking about the shortage of labor either. So it's like all of


00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:20.600
of these things I think should be kind of taken into account when we have these conversations.


00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:29.000
Is it actually ethical to keep forcing people to make coffee? Because not at this rate for these places.


00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:38.840
So that was just a context of like Colombia, where you are, how much coffee we're going to be


00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.560
working with, how much, you know, something to keep in mind also, like I said, it's just the


00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.980
waste, how much of it takes and where does that waste go. Something that's that


00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:53.020
I'll point out again tomorrow, but when we're pulping the coffee we we're gonna


00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.700
be pulping, taking the cascara to one side and then keeping the parchment and


00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:01.420
then some of that sometimes that gets composted. That takes a lot of effort.


00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:06.700
Sometimes it's just thrown back into the farm just like semi-composted like it


00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:11.700
just kind of goes back but it's not a great method. And then most of the time


00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:16.580
It's not really that effort to separate it. And so even here in this


00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.560
hotel


00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.200
They have a pulper down by the river and the tradition is just you just pulp it


00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:28.860
It goes into the river just goes into the water supply and even here you'll see the pulper just go straight into the river


00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:36.220
I don't know if I included them here. I also had some pictures of my time in Burundi where we're using


00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.120
the river water to pull and process the coffee and in the same picture upstream


00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.300
there's like a couple of boys just like bathing and bathing and washing their


00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:50.860
clothes in the river that we're using to pull coffee and at first my my the


00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.980
reason I took that picture was because I was thinking as a microbiologist I'm


00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.980
like our water is a source of contamination like I gotta figure out


00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:02.340
how to get them a better water source and it just it took me way too long to


00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.300
flip that and say no this is their drinking water this is your using water


00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.640
We're using their processing water.


00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.240
We're contaminating their water.


00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.120
They're not contaminating my processing water.


00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.200
So it's just this, like--


00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.640
again, we have all these very rustic practices for coffee.


00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.680
And I think a lot of times, we're just getting really


00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.120
carried away with the technology of brewing and the


00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.920
things that are exciting, and forgetting how little


00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.180
technology we have at the source, and how little


00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.920
innovation there is at this point.


00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.360
It's still very manual.


00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.160
We're still picking by hand.


00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.120
And I'm like, make some, I don't know, drones or something.


00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.800
Like, let's put some effort on this side.


00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.000
But again, that's not my specialty.


00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.560
So now, the reason you're here, microbiology.


00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:55.120
So part of the context of this week


00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:00.120
is there's so much confusion


00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.080
in terms of how we talk about processing.


00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.800
And it's such a rich source for producers


00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.920
to have some agency,


00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.800
for producers to differentiate their copy.


00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.920
Like it's such a tool that's very underutilized.


00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.520
Here's something that producers can do to stand out,


00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.860
but it's very confusing.


00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.600
And so many people are lost on both ends.


00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.840
Producers call me and they're like,


00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.120
"I was asked for a double carbonic maceration.


00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.240
I don't know what that is."


00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.260
And then roasters ask me,


00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.320
"Well, I received this like semi-washed natural.


00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.760
I don't know what it is."


00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.440
What are they talking about?


00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.380
So it's a little bit of the blind leading the blind.


00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.180
And so in addition to all of these labels


00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.540
that are somewhat confusing,


00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.520
and all of the other things that are kind of


00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.160
coming on top of that, right?


00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:47.100
Thermo shock, all of the red, purple, black honeys,


00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.080
white honeys, hydro honeys.


00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:53.340
I think that it's important,


00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.800
like I'm not here to make a dictionary.


00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.300
I don't want to define these terms.


00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.040
I want producers to be creative.


00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.520
I want producers to come up with cool names.


00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.100
I want all of this weird stuff to happen,


00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.600
but I want producers to be able to defend their choices


00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.500
and to defend, like, I called it this because of this.


00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.000
This is what lactic means here.


00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.720
This is why I called it anaerobic.


00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.880
Right now I'm seeing a little too much copy/paste.


00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.260
This is what this person said.


00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.400
I'm just gonna do what they did.


00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.640
And then when you ask them, they're like, I don't know.


00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.480
I put it under water.


00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.160
It's anaerobic.


00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.000
So the point isn't to police naming.


00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
The point is to give you confidence and to give the producers that are here confidence


00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.640
as to why I'm naming it this way.


00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.120
And even if everybody has a different definition to like stand really firm and say,


00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.760
I called it this because of this and this is my understanding.


00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:45.440
So I'm not trying to eliminate these names or say that any of them are bad.


00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.180
It's just why.


00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.580
Just being, again, having that confidence.


00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.100
So the way that I look at coffee processing


00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.780
is 100% influenced by my background in winemaking.


00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.900
And these two pictures are both places where I worked.


00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.260
Opus One, this is a vineyard.


00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:09.100
And then Cliff Laney is the winery.


00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.900
And when I show this picture of Opus One


00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.180
to most coffee producers, they find it very foreign


00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.900
to have neat rows, very aligned, nothing in the middle,


00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:26.700
very clean and no shade, just completely uniform.


00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.180
And the other thing to point out is


00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.500
that wineries are very clean, very beautiful places.


00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.180
They are showpieces.


00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:39.540
Even a very mid-tier, smaller winery


00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.660
will still treat their space this way.


00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.020
And there's not that same concern


00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.860
or that same energy put into most coffee mills.


00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.480
And I think that's definitely changing.


00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.560
I don't think they need to go to that extreme.


00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.020
But it's something to keep in mind,


00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:57.000
that we want to process coffee like wine.


00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.320
But again, we're still not treating it holistically


00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.480
like we do wine.


00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.680
And the other part that's funny is when I show this,


00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.180
to most producers, they're like, I don't know what that is,


00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.080
unless you're in Brazil.


00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.560
In Brazil, it's flat.


00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.760
It's uniform.


00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.360
It's mechanically harvested.


00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.480
So Brazil producers are very, very familiar with this.


00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.360
no shade, completely exposed.


00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.920
And I've seen some farms in Hawaii, too,


00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:28.640
that are very uniform, very aesthetically pleasing as well.


00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.600
And they're very nice.


00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:37.120
So I started in coffee in 2014.


00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.000
But this is me shuttling out a tank of grapes in Napa.


00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
And this is shuttling, mixing some coffee.


00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.120
So it's a different product, grapes and coffee.


00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.160
But there's a lot of principles that we can apply.


00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.840
There's a lot of winemaking principles.


00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.440
There's a lot of fundamentals that translate


00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.760
from one product to the other.


00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.040
So in terms of processing and doing fermentations,


00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.180
I have 15 years of experience doing this type of work.


00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:08.640
This is also to give you an idea of context


00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.240
of the different countries that I've worked in


00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.640
and the different scenarios and scales,


00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:18.600
Because I get so much resistance of, well, that works in Kenya,


00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.960
but it doesn't work in Guatemala.


00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.200
Or that works over there, but it doesn't work here.


00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.240
And yes, countries are different,


00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.400
and we need to respect that.


00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.400
But there's so much fundamental basics


00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.080
that translate region, that translate altitude,


00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.880
that translate variety.


00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.460
So that's what we're going to focus on.


00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.440
So this is my favorite quote.


00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.840
It's an economist, Lionel Robbins said,


00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.180
we all talk about the same things,


00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.080
but we have not yet agreed what it is we are talking about.


00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.760
I think this is really, really true for fermentation.


00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.600
I think a lot of us use the word fermentation


00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.880
and we mean very different things,


00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.480
or it means very different things kind of culturally


00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.200
or just by language.


00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.720
I think there's a lot of challenges


00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.480
in all the different languages that we speak in coffee.


00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.240
So like I mentioned before, we have very different levels here.


00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.460
We have surgeons.


00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.580
We have very educated people that went to medical school,


00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.880
people that are getting their masters.


00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.540
And we have coffee lovers.


00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.940
And so I don't have a lot of background in coffee.


00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.340
So just being a little bit patient with some


00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.440
of these basics, like we're just setting up the foundation


00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.440
so that everybody's on the same page from all


00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.340
of these different backgrounds.


00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.380
So this is going to start very basic,


00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.140
but we'll pick up.


00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.700
And this is to give you an idea of,


00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.500
okay, we have natural and we have washed coffee.


00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:49.500
And these two forms are the most flavor difference


00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:50.340
that we've known.


00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.300
These are kind of the beginnings


00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.420
of how we can process coffee,


00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.500
what we can do with this coffee cherry.


00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.660
And we both know that these two methods


00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:00.400
have very different flavor results.


00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.300
If I do something different to my coffee,


00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.660
I'm gonna get a different flavor in my cup.


00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:13.280
So the first thing I really want to break the bad habit of is saying that a wet process


00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.280
is a washed.


00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:19.680
I've seen so many websites and so many labels use that word interchangeably, wet and washed.


00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.300
Because they both have to do with water, so I can see sort of the confusion of, oh, wet


00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.220
washed process.


00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.340
But wet process is defined by the pulping step.


00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.940
It has nothing to do with water.


00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:36.140
So you can have your cherry and then you say, "Are we going to pulp it or not?"


00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.620
Meaning, "Are we going to remove the skin?"


00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.660
If no, then it's a natural and it's a dry process.


00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:45.040
It still has its skin, dry process, natural.


00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:51.420
If we remove the pulp, then most likely it's a washed, but it's also a wet.


00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.860
It's a wet process.


00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.540
So we can have a cherry that we pulp without water.


00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:59.420
can we just pump it and expose the music?
