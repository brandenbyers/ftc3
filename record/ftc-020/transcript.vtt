WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
It's not just a preference, that's a necessity in terms of we need the acidity to break down


00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.200
the pectin bonds and make the mucilage, like what we saw, we added that 2 pH and we just


00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.800
immediately dissolved it.


00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.480
So you also don't have to worry about that if you're not at that low pH, you're probably


00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.400
not done fermenting because there's not enough acidity to make the mucilage dissolve.


00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.400
Oh, okay.


00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.600
So it's more like a signal that you've gotten there.


00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.400
Yeah, it's a signal that you've gotten there.


00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.400
You don't have to like try to get there.


00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.000
You will get there and you're just, you know, your job I see or my job I see is just kind


00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.200
of seeing how quickly I get there, when I get there, or sort of the conditions around


00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.200
it.


00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.200
But I'm not trying to like force any situation.


00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.200
I'm not trying to like make it go there.


00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.200
And that's the case for like for yeast, for lactate, for different types of fermentation?


00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.200
Or does it vary depending on the type of yeast?


00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.200
They're very dependent on the species, the identity of the microbes.


00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.200
So because I work with a lot of different species, I'm not really able to say, "Oh,


00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.200
I'm going to make a yeast."


00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.200
I'm not able to say, "Oh, I'm going to make a yeast."


00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.200
I'm not able to say, "Oh, I'm going to make a yeast."


00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.200
or does it vary depending on the type of bacteria?


00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.200
They're very dependent on the species, the identity of the microbes.


00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.200
So because I work with Saccharomyces, I know that that's their tendency.


00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.200
So for other bacteria it was different, but you at least need that acidified environment to remove your mucilage.


00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.200
So if you're not removing your mucilage, if you remember the picture before of your book,


00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.720
of these tissue layers. If you're not, if you're not removing your


00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.120
micellar, you're not getting those flavors into your fermentation anyway. So


00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.280
you wouldn't want to wash it and pull it out because you haven't accomplished


00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.800
like maybe the primary goal of getting flavors and you're not accomplishing


00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.840
the goal of making it easy to wash and dry and like your workflow. So it affects


00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.680
your workflow and you really haven't accomplished your primary goal. So it's


00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.000
It's not like I would never look at a number


00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.480
and make a decision based on a number.


00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.280
Like, oh, my pH is 2.9, make a decision.


00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.600
I would say, my pH is 2.9, what does my coffee feel like?


00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.000
What does it smell like?


00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.560
What does it look like?


00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.200
Plus the pH of 2.9, now I make a decision.


00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.520
- Got it.


00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.560
- So numbers are difficult that way.


00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.920
They're very helpful, but they can be very tricky


00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.320
because maybe my pH meters aren't calibrated.


00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.600
definitely don't make a decision based on your pH meter. It's way more likely that your pH meter is


00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:28.960
uncalibrated. I really go by feel, smell, touch, sounds. Yeah. Is it possible to have a fermentation stall in


00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:36.960
wine and coffee? Yeah. It is definitely possible to have it stall. It's less of a problem in coffee


00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.960
than it is in wine because in wine the fermentation is so much longer. So you have 30 days where


00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.620
or something can go wrong in your fermentation.


00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.580
And in coffee, if you're only fermenting for 24 hours,


00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.580
there's less of an opportunity for something to get in the way.


00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.380
But in wine, a fermentation usually stalls


00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.900
because your yeast get either too toxic--


00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.580
so it went too fast, they made too much alcohol,


00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.540
and the yeast poisoned themselves, and then they die.


00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.300
And then you're really in trouble,


00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.100
because now you have to start it again, starting


00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.860
in a really toxic place.


00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.860
And so you have to be very gentle.


00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.140
You have to restart your culture of your yeast.


00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.780
You have to acclimate them slowly


00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.180
to get to that toxic point.


00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.820
And then you reintroduce them.


00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.060
It's a huge, huge problem, a huge time


00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.380
set in the wine industry to have a stuck fermentation.


00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.340
And it happens a lot.


00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.060
So in coffee, we don't have that problem.


00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.700
Again, our fermentations are shorter.


00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.740
We have less time.


00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.420
And we don't start with as much sugar.


00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.100
So a wine fermentation, a juice, will


00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:45.100
start at breaks of 24-25. That's a lot of sugar. That in and of itself is very toxic.


00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:52.100
Really high sugar environments are toxic to a lot of microorganisms. That's why honey is anti-bacterial.


00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.100
Honey, it's so much sugar that you think, oh, that's so much fuel, but actually it's toxic


00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.100
so a lot of things don't grow in honey, and can.


00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:10.100
I didn't smell any alcohol here. Is that because there's no alcohol or because it's so diluted?


00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.100
It's pretty diluted. There is some amount of alcohol in there. You'll probably get like 2-3%.


00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:24.100
But at that level, it's also very volatile. So when we're mixing, every time Zaoistan is mixing, some of that alcohol is volatilizing.


00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.100
And very little is in your coffee. You're not going to get alcohol in your coffee.


00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.100
It's not a concern.


00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.100
What happens when you do, I've had one where it was obviously alcoholic.


00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.100
What is that?


00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.100
So it's not like ethanol that is going to affect you because that would be burned off in your roasting as well.


00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.100
It's the characteristics of something that's like rum flavor or like some liquor, some alcoholic beverage.


00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.100
So it's more like the sensory attributes of that alcohol but not like ethanol that would actually make you drunk.


00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:04.100
So yes, you can get boozy flavor notes, but it's not ethanol booze.


00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:11.100
So today we found that the moonfish is almost gone.


00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.100
What happens if we just put some sugar in the sugar to shine?


00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.100
Yeah, you can kick start it. So if you noticed, it was still very active.


00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.100
I'm still very happy with the level of bubbles and the level of activity that we saw in the fermentation.


00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.100
But it is a little bit less than yesterday around this time.


00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.100
Part of it I think is the temperature.


00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.100
Like you just had a cool night.


00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.100
So it just kind of had a chance to rest.


00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.100
So maybe at lunch time we'll see it perk back up.


00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.100
But if you don't see it perk back up,


00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.100
and let's say for some reason you have a goal.


00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.100
I'm not here to judge you.


00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.100
If you have a goal of I want a five day fermentation.


00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.100
And now it's day two and you see this low activity,


00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.100
I would feed it.


00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.700
I would give something, some fruit juice, some vanilla, something that you have around


00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.700
if you're like, "I need to make it to the end."


00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.100
I would definitely try to feed my fermentation some amount of sugar source so that it can


00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.100
last for another three days.


00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:13.100
And when you say low activity, like how would you, how would someone be able to detect that?


00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.100
It's a little bit more individual, so it's sort of your experience.


00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.060
experience like it's low activity for me like my standard of low activity


00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.060
because I've seen so many fermentations so it's something that you kind of have


00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.020
to have more experience and say what is low for each person. It's an individual.


00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:36.540
It's like a visual cue or multi-period? I would say it's both. Not only is it visual because you can see the


00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.180
bubbles but you can also a lot of the times of fermentation you can hear it.


00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.060
It's popping a lot of those bubbles so you have that clue as well and how much kind of


00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.640
of aromatics are coming off of the fermentation,


00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.760
coupled with how quickly is my pH dropping?


00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.880
Is my pH just staying the same?


00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.680
Is every single measurement exactly the same?


00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.980
That's another indication.


00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.080
But again, maybe my pH is exactly the same


00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.960
and it's stalled and it's not moving,


00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.240
it's not moving, it's not moving,


00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.760
but I'm still seeing visual activity.


00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.800
I'm still seeing a lot of bubbles


00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.520
and I'm seeing a lot of, yeah, signs of life.


00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.360
I'm not gonna get worried yet.


00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:26.360
If I have both, if I have no sense of life and no movement, that's when I would decide if I'm going to wash my coffee or I'm going to feed it, I'm going to try to restart it, maybe I'm going to try to heat it up, maybe it's too cold.


00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:32.360
If you do something like a big tank, how are you going to mix that?


00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:42.360
So I've shown some pictures where you get in the tank, I got the workers put on boots and you get in and you're shoveling it all around so all the big sugar pools, you have to get inside of it.


00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:50.360
I think Caleb's already designing a mechanical arm that's going to mix the tank.


00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.360
Heat and mix, potentially.


00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.360
So yeah, mixing is a big part of it.


00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.360
Because even in the small one, you saw the temperature.


00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.360
You felt the temperature difference.


00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.360
The top, the sides, the middle.


00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.360
That happens very easily.


00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.360
So mixing is important to homogenize the temperature


00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.360
and to spread the yeast to maybe parts of the coffee that have more food than others.


00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:16.360
Yeah, because in Thailand, I mean, before that, we just have to put the lock on the lid and just rolling the...


00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.360
I like that method. If you're doing in barrels and you're able to close it and you can roll it.


00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.360
Yeah, but it's so heavy.


00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.360
Yeah, it's heavy.


00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:33.360
This could be something that you could maybe use from the wine industry because, you know, wine is aged in barrels and the barrels need to be washed.


00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:45.360
So the way that they wash the barrels is they pick up these barrels on their side, they put them on these wheels, and you have the hose that goes into the hole, the balloon hole, goes up there and then it washes the barrel from the inside.


00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.360
And so you have these, kind of like a platform with wheels that is constantly rolling the barrel.


00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:58.360
So you could reconfigure a wine barrel washer to be a coffee mixer.


00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.360
I love the idea of a cement mixer as a tank.


00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.200
Something that's dipped and that's constantly agitating,


00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.840
slowly, not like a large rotation,


00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.200
but something that's slowly moving the coffee,


00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.480
I think would be really helpful,


00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.800
instead of like the three times a day that we're doing,


00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.120
just having some of that contact.


00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.480
Because then you could also, I think,


00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.160
have even less liquid,


00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
because you're constantly moving that mass.


00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.440
So you concentrate the flavor a little bit more.


00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:34.440
If we have to open the lid and mix like this, is there any disadvantage or any downside?


00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.440
The huge downside, the biggest downside to all of this opening and mixing is contamination.


00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.440
Every time I open it and my paddle is not clean, all the contamination we did with our own hands,


00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.440
sticking it in there, every time I'm putting my pH meter, my thermometer, all of these things,


00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.440
there's a chance for contamination.


00:09:51.440 --> 00:10:00.440
So, do as I say, not as I do. Best practices, spray with alcohol, like a bottle of alcohol before you go into your fermentation.


00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:06.440
If you're trying to protect your, if you're trying to protect like your mouth.


00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.440
Maybe you're not, maybe you're just trying to bite, whatever. Maybe.


00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:18.440
So, something that we've talked a lot with Julie about is this idea of newer regions of coffee that don't have a strong history of coffee or a strong history of cacao,


00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:25.440
So, when I was working in California and was working with coffee, their fermentations,


00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.440
nothing was happening.


00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.440
Because coffee hasn't been grown in California very well.


00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.440
So they didn't have these microbes coming in and the fermentation was stalled and they


00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.440
were getting more like decomposition.


00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.440
And you were telling me about cacao in Hawaii not having a very, I'll let you say it.


00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.440
Yeah, so all the farmers that are starting to grow cacao, it's like a very, very new


00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.440
crop mentality.


00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.440
And so, it's not a very good crop.


00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.440
It's not a very good crop.


00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.440
And so, it's not a very good crop.


00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.440
And so, it's not a very good crop.


00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.440
And so, it's not a very good crop.


00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.440
And so, it's not a very good crop.


00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.440
And so, it's not a very good crop.


00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.440
And so, it's not a very good crop.


00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.440
I'll let you say it.


00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.440
Yeah, so all the farmers that are starting to grow cacao,


00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.440
it's like a very, very new crop in Hawaii.


00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.440
And they're having a really hard time getting fermentations going


00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.440
because their microbial load is really low.


00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.440
And they've had this very big question mark over their minds.


00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.440
Why isn't our cacao fermenting?


00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.440
Whereas if you go to Ecuador or all of these mature growing regions,


00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.440
you don't even have to have a big mass.


00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.440
You can grow it in a bucket and it just starts bubbling away.


00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.360
So I showed them Lucy's podcast, which is super cool,


00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.520
just to try to get them on the right direction on maybe


00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.920
what kind of research they should come in and focus on.


00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.920
Same concept.


00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.000
So in that situation in Hawaii, maybe you


00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.720
want as many people as possible coming


00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.040
to touch somebody who's harvesting your papayas


00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.440
and pineapples to come and touch your cacao as well.


00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.720
So there's not any one best practice.


00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.100
It's like, what are we trying to achieve in these places?


00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:45.100
We may need to have some of this, you know, lax hygiene to just build up that mass.


00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:54.100
And then in more established places, where it's been growing a long time, now it's really


00:11:54.100 --> 00:12:01.100
important for us to have hygiene and to like clean our paddles and to clean our equipment


00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.100
and to not have everybody touching our coffee.


00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.900
And a very common practice in Africa


00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.300
is to just get in with your feet.


00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.500
And you can move with your bare feet.


00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.300
It's like we were doing with the buckets


00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.060
yesterday, how you were physically rubbing the coffee


00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.900
to get the mucilage off.


00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.460
Well, a lot of times, it's easier


00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.300
to do with your feet in the big tanks.


00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.620
So that's inoculating.


00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:26.620
That's kind of giving a flavor of the coffee.


00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:33.860
And if the two bags run out, and our yeast starts to die,


00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.700
I mean, how can we know that and what's going to happen next?


00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.860
What's going to happen next?


00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.740
OK, that's a really great question.


00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.740
So if your sugar is completely depleted,


00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.220
and we know sugar is the yeast's favorite source of food,


00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.060
then what happens next if you're going to keep


00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.860
going on your fermentation?


00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.420
So as the yeast are consuming sugar,


00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.860
they're giving off all of these other metabolites.


00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.460
They're creating organic acids.


00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.620
They're creating those esters and thiols and carbon dioxide.


00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.860
So there's, remember we didn't sanitize, right?


00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.620
So there's still other microbes there.


00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.140
We've out-competed them, we've dominated them,


00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.100
we've kind of put them uphold.


00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.300
But as soon as this opportunity opens up,


00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.760
like it's a window, it's an ecological window,


00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.580
where now the yeast is dying,


00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.420
so it's not taking up this space.


00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.300
Their food is gone, they've made all of this acid,


00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.660
they've made all of this citric acid, for example.


00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.620
Then there's some lactic acid bacteria there


00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.660
that's gonna eat that citric acid


00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.020
and then have its own fermentation.


00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.020
So now you can have it be bacteria dominated.


00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.500
[INAUDIBLE]


00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.820
So even if your yeast are dead, you're


00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.980
still going to have microbial activity of some other kind.


00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.940
You've opened up this opportunity.


00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:52.900
So we did talk about this yesterday, right?


00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:53.900
You saw this picture?


00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:59.540
So this is an idea that I really want


00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:06.420
break in our vocabulary talking about over fermentation, talking about this idea that


00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:12.180
it's linear and that it's time dependent. So that's my problem with the word over because


00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:18.340
it implies some relationship of time where we're okay at some point, we're okay, we're


00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:23.620
okay, we're okay, and suddenly we went over. There's a point at which we have ruined our


00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:24.620
And I don't think that's true.


00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.620
Also from experience, I've had coffees that have been fermented 400 hours that taste very


00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.620
clean, very lovely, that are just balanced and great.


00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.620
So I think that's a good thing.


00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:28.620
And I think that's a good thing.


00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.620
And I think that's a good thing.


00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.620
And I think that's a good thing.


00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.620
And I think that's a good thing.


00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.620
And I think that's a good thing.


00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.620
And I think that's a good thing.


00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.620
And I think that's a good thing.


00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.620
And I think that's a good thing.


00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.620
And I think that's a good thing.


00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.620
And I think that's a good thing.


00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.620
And I think that's a good thing.


00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.620
And I think that's a good thing.


00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.620
And I think that's a good thing.


00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.620
And I think that's a good thing.


00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:53.620
And I don't think that's true. Also from experience, I've had coffees that have been fermented 400 hours and taste very clean, very lovely, that are just balanced and great.


00:14:53.620 --> 00:15:02.620
And I've had coffees that were processed in 12 hours and are just nasty and have some overripe fruit that have these characteristics.


00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:07.620
So it's not to do with time.


00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.620
Instead, I want you to think about fermentation as this kind of global map.


00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.620
And you can take these many different roads.


00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:20.620
And so you can start out--so number one down here is kind of the traditional sense,


00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.620
where each of these rings is time.


00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:28.620
So you can have 24 hours, 48, 72, and at some point we pass into this red defect area.


00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.620
That's traditionally what we thought.


00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.620
And then number two is the one I described where you can immediately get into the defects.


00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.620
You can immediately get contaminated and it doesn't have to do with time.


00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.620
It's just the microbes that are there that you will immediately have a defect situation.


00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:50.620
Or you can be blissful in this section three where maybe you sanitize, you are really careful


00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.620
about cross-contamination, you've inoculated, and then you can just go on this really lovely


00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:59.620
path for a very, very long time and not have a defect.


00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.340
So all of these are possible.


00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.300
So instead of talking about over-fermentation,


00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.180
I think we should talk about what we mean.


00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.300
What are the defects that we're actually tasting?


00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.860
Are we tasting something boozy?


00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.460
Are we tasting something with rotting fruit?


00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.740
Are we tasting ethyl alcohol, like male alcohol, for example?


00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:23.060
Are we tasting vinegar?


00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.700
So let's name the defect that we're tasting instead


00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.180
of just saying over-ferment.


00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.540
Because that can mean different things to different people


00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.540
And it's also not a correct way to think about fermentation.


00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.540
And it keeps producers feeling really uncomfortable in fermentation.


00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.540
All my life I've been told over-fermentation is bad.


00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.540
Why do I want to ferment for a long time?


00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:47.540
So our language is really getting in the way of, I think, some progress in this sense.


00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:51.540
And one of the things that came up, Valeria, because she's so bright,


00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.540
she said, "Well, look at what you did with number two.


00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.540
Does that mean that if number two had kept going, it could have been saved?"


00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.940
in this yellow zone, it could have been rescued.


00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.700
And I think so.


00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.700
I think this is also a possibility.


00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.540
A little bit with what we talked about with Cecil,


00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.100
where you had your power go out,


00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.540
you had all of this fruit sitting there,


00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:18.500
and you were headed in this path to defect city,


00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.940
which is why you gave your property away,


00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.780
'cause you said, "I don't know what to do with this."


00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.340
And you didn't know when the power was gonna be back,


00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.340
and it could be a lot longer.


00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.900
So he was in defect city.


00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.780
But he would maybe potentially wait.


00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.540
He would put the coffee in water, lower the temperature.


00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.580
And then when the power was back two days later,


00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.300
he pulped it and did something fast like a citric.


00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.380
With more time, this defect could have headed into saving.


00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.580
You could have kind of like swerved the car


00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:49.340
and headed in a different direction, potentially.


00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.380
So it's not that--


00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.300
but that does take a little bit more skill.


00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.660
So that's not for beginners or faint of heart


00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.700
to say, how am I going to right this ship?


00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.940
But it's possible, I believe.


00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.100
So I want fermentation to be thought


00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.820
of as kind of this roadmap.


00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.420
You're saying, what path am I going to take?


00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:11.300
And thinking about safe fermentations


00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:16.100
and risky fermentations, or undesirable fermentations.


00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.620
Much better than just over-fermentation.


00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:24.580
Undesirable, positive, safe fermentations.


00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.420
Does this make sense?


00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.780
this concept of we're all going to stop using over-fermentation?


00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.240
[LAUGHTER]


00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:36.380
So along those terms of vocabulary


00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:41.220
and how we name things, this is another term


00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.020
that is very overused and poorly understood--


00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.660
double fermentation.


00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.580
And we barely understand fermentation,


00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:53.740
but we're so willing to be like, double, triple fermentation.


00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.500
So this came from the process in Kenya,


00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.340
where the way that they process coffee in Kenya


00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.580
is pulping, they don't do naturals,


00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.460
they pulp the coffee, and they do a dry,


00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.060
meaning an unsubmerged fermentation in a tank.


00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.060
And this was the way that they did it for a very long time,


00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.620
and then they would go wash the coffee and set it to dry.


00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.180
Well, one season, there was just way too much coffee,


00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.660
they had a really big problem,


00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.140
and they didn't have enough patio space,


00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:26.820
and they couldn't dry the coffee at a good rate.


00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:31.820
So in order to buy time, to pause, to gain time,


00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.300
they decided to wash the coffee and submerge it in water


00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.220
because this is a preservation method.


00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.900
So now they added this extra step,


00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.380
it's putting it in the fridge.


00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.340
So we're just gonna wait until the patio's disoccupied


00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.100
and then we're gonna move forward.


00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.180
And then at the end of the season


00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.580
when all those coffees were cupped,


00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.340
they're like, they taste brilliant and amazing


00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:56.340
and they taste really good, now we're going to make this the standard instead of like the emergency plan.


00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:00.340
Like this is what we're going to do all the time because we think the coffee is better.


00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:08.340
And this nomenclature comes from the time when we thought everything that happens in a tank is fermentation


00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.340
and everything that happens outside of a tank is not.


00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:18.340
So before it was honeys and naturals and patios had no fermentation and only washed coffees had fermentations.


00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.540
And now we know that's not true because we understand microbes.


00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.540
And we know that all of the other methods also have fermentation.


00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.940
But then they said, well, this submerged in water is also a fermentation


00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.740
because it's happening inside the tank.


00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.140
So, like, anything that is tank-related is a fermentation.


00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.140
So they said it's a double fermentation,


00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.540
even though the point of this first part is to build up flavors.


00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.540
And the point of this is to stop.


00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:49.540
The goal in this submerged is to do nothing.


00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.540
It's to just stop time and be able to go onto the patio.


00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.540
Now that doesn't mean that nothing is happening here.


00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:59.540
We've talked a little bit about, we have all this moisture,


00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.540
the seed has been liberated, it doesn't have the exocarp,


00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:06.540
so it is potentially available to germinate.


00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:10.540
There is some evidence that these seeds are pre-germinating,


00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.540
or starting that process.


00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:19.140
So it's not that they're completely inert, but it's not a fermentation. Whatever is happening is something else.


00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:34.820
Well, the goal of this, what they did there was they washed it all before.


00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.500
So it's not like they took this coffee and then just added water.


00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.900
They washed the coffee very thoroughly as much as they could and then they put it in water.


00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:48.900
So I'm not saying that they could reach 100% perfect cleanliness, but they want it to.


00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:54.900
Their goal is to reach 100% cleanliness, so that there isn't any more activity here.


00:21:54.900 --> 00:22:12.880
[INAUDIBLE]


00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.880
If they did?


00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:14.380
Yes.


00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.880
So you're not talking about this.


00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.380
You're saying somebody else--


00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:17.880
Yes.


00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.880
--took their coffee, washed it, put it back in the tank.


00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:32.860
[INAUDIBLE]


00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.860
Yeah, so you could restart another fermentation.


00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.860
You could do this, have your clean parchment,


00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.360
put it into another tank, add more mucilage.


00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.360
But that's the key.


00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.860
You have to add something.


00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:47.360
You have to add some kind of pool to keep going


00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.860
or to have more of an impact.


00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.340
But isn't it stressful for the seed?


00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.820
I mean, if you like, start the process,


00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.320
and then you restart the process,


00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.300
it's not like immediately you have to wash it.


00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.300
I think it is stressful for the seed


00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.780
to have all of this manipulation.


00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.780
I think when you also think about scale,


00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.780
and you think about either these big containers


00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.780
and all of the weight of the ones on top


00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.780
and the pushing down on the ones on the bottom.


00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.780
So any type of additional processing


00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.280
is additional physical stress.


00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.280
It's just sheer strength forcing this delicate structure,


00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:26.120
which I think has a lot to do with longevity and storage


00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.280
of these coffees while germ, which is really hard to measure


00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.880
because most people process, sell their coffee,


00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.560
you cup them, it gets an 86 and you're like, great, let's go.


00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.160
And not very many people, unless you're the roaster,


00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.400
being aware of, I've had this coffee for six months


00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.840
and it's been changing.


00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.340
There's not that immediate feedback.


00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.760
So a lot of that stress, you're not


00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:58.760
And so, you're not going to be able to notice right away. And that's why these highly processed coffees puff really well, and then they fall. And then they faint. And then they just kind of...they don't maintain.


00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:05.760
But initially, you're not going to notice that. So a lot of the producers don't have the feedback to like, maybe calm down a little bit. Or maybe be a little bit more gentle.


00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.760
Because it puffs really well, so then they're more excited to do more. And so then you have these like...


00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.760
Nico gave me the term of "Brutalist fermentation."


00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.760
So you just put through all of these steps and put through the ringer.


00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:26.760
And so many where they take the cherries, and they put them on the bed, and they dry them perfect, and they re-soak them, and they put them again.


00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.760
I read a process that was like five cycles of that.


00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.760
From tank to bed, from tank to bed, and all of these additional...


00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.760
And again, it makes sense.


00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.760
They don't know, because no one's ever told them,


00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.760
or the researchers are not able to cup their coffee 18 months


00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.760
later, that this is connected.


00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.760
So it's like the feedback cycle is broken.


00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.760
So that one, the slide was, did they just take it out of the--


00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.760
there's no resilage on there.


00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.760
They took it out of the tank where they had patio space,


00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.760
and they just set it to dry.


00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:05.300
So traditionally, yes, there was tank space.


00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.540
But after they did this experiment-- not experiment,


00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:08.580
it was just an emergency.


00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.580
It was a tree accident.


00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:10.500
It was an accident.


00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.180
They're like, we don't have space.


00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.140
Then they cupped it.


00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.460
Because Kenya does have a really good system


00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.220
of their auction system of cupping all of their copies


00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.820
and having that feedback to producers.


00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.780
It's a very unique buying system that Kenya has.


00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.580
So they were able to give producers feedback


00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:29.420
immediately and say, everybody, we're changing the process.


00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.020
This is what you have to do.


00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.660
and it works out really well.


00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:38.460
So for me, this method also, in this dry fermentation,


00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.980
you have much higher heat, more intensity.


00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.960
So I think part of the reason why it made the coffee better


00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.100
is not that this--


00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.980
so a lot of people talk about the soap improving the coffee.


00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.180
It makes it better.


00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.460
I don't think this step is additive.


00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:56.220
I think this step corrects for any defects that


00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.900
were produced in the first part.


00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.440
So I think in the first part, you're


00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.140
building all of these towers of molecules,


00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.100
and some of them are very intense in one direction.


00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.340
And then having this submerge can either


00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.460
pull out some of those concentrations,


00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.740
even out the lot, and then you have this less bad.


00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.020
It's not improving it, it's just making it less bad.


00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.860
- But they take it right from the submerge,


00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.540
now take it right from the submerge tank


00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.860
and put it out to dry.


00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.180
- Correct.


00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.820
- So they don't do an additional--


00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.540
- It depends, if they don't have space,


00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.140
I've seen places that'll do like a three-soak cycle.


00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.700
Take the water out, put fresh water,


00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.780
take it out and then put fresh water up to like three cycles


00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.220
which is insanely water intensive.


00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.060
- Yeah.


00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.940
- I can't, like these countries, I can just like do that.


00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.540
Like just swimming pools of water


00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:45.980
just to process their coffee.


00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.620
But I think that's part of it,


00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.660
this method that oh, soaps make it better.


00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.380
Not understanding what a soap is doing.


00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.700
The water is able to pull out molecules,


00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.200
It's not adding anything back to the coffee.


00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.460
- So it's more like safety.


00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.380
- Safeness.


00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:07.160
It's a safety measure, yes.


00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.820
- I think what everybody, I don't know,


00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.580
at least what I've been told is


00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.600
this is a really huge factory in South Africa,


00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.600
it was in Charlottesville.


00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.360
They pump it, they soak it for like 24, 48 hours


00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.360
in the trains, just to soak the moustache.


00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:27.360
Then they leave it to go through the channels to wash it,


00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.960
just because the moussache is soft enough.


00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.760
And through the channels it's just being washed


00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.760
and then they put the clean parchment


00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.560
and they're ready to try it.


00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.880
Then right now, for example, in Ethiopia,


00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.320
it's getting most popular, this dry fermentation.


00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.600
It's again like 12, 24, up to 48 hours.


00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.200
So they leave it, as you see in the picture, dry,


00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.640
just to get a bit extra boozy.


00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.920
No, no, no, I mean, it's not a boozy flavor.


00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.220
It's just like, you know,


00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:01.920
you twist a bit the volume of the flavors


00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.040
and then they do the same.


00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.280
They just basically, I think they're gonna skip


00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.080
the submerging part of the thing


00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.600
and they're just gonna wash it through the channels.


00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.120
And that's basically it.


00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.200
- In India?


00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.720
- Yeah, but about the dry,


00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.960
that's actually a question of what is,


00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.080
what is the thing better?


00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:22.080
So you just keep it dry, like this, 12, 24 hours.


00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.300
And then submerge it, and then wash it through the channels,


00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.380
or just wash it straight away.


00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.460
- Well, so this is a difficult part with Kenya,


00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.180
because it's some of the best coffee in the world,


00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:34.940
and I really enjoy Kenyan coffees,


00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.860
and I'm not gonna sell them if their method is wrong.


00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.860
But for me, it's like, this came out of necessity.


00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.300
So the dry soap, you're building up these flavors,


00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.460
potentially some defects,


00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:49.460
And then you have a second step of removing the thing that you made in the first place.


00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:53.460
So the reason I like to work with the yeast is because I get to do both at the same time.


00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:58.460
So instead of these two discrete separate steps, I combine them into one so that we're


00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:02.460
using, we're inoculating with yeast to build up the flavors, but I've submerged the whole


00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:06.460
time so I have that homogeneity.


00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.460
So I'm not saying that it's a better method.


00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:13.460
I'm saying that I think that this method clearly was made out of necessity, but I think we


00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.620
to accomplish most of the same thing.


00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.500
I'm not saying I can make a Kenyan-style coffee,


00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.340
but I'm saying what we're doing with the submerged fermentation


00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.860
is trying to collapse both of these steps


00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.700
to just do it once instead of doing it twice.


00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.140
So the question is, what do I think is better?


00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.820
Well, it depends what you're trying to accomplish.


00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.820
My method, where you collapse them both,


00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.340
is maybe not better if I don't have enough space.


00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.380
Maybe it is better to put it in two steps


00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.140
so that I make my process longer so that I can


00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.020
have enough space in my patio.


00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.580
So I actually never think about, or rarely


00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.780
do I think about flavor when I think about what's best.


00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.140
I think about my workflow.


00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.620
I think, how much space do I have?


00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.100
Who's here to work?


00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.620
What time of day is it?


00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.820
I don't make decisions based on flavor.


00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:02.860
I make decisions based on people, personnel, weather,


00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.380
and everything else.


00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.100
So sometimes this would be a much better method


00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.500
if there's no space.


00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.980
But if I have space, I can collapse it.


00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:12.980
Cecil, you had a question?


00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.980
Enhances in color, would it be in a different way?


00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:16.980
What enhances the color?


00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.980
When you soak the paint.


00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.980
Enhancing meaning like making it...


00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.980
More blue or blue-green or more intense?


00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:32.980
I haven't heard that. I would think that it may enhance the color.


00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:36.980
Enhance again, not by making it better, but either by taking out some of that dye


00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.980
where we see some that are a little bit more reddish and pinkish on the outside


00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:47.540
you could get a little bit more of a visually cleaner look. I think that's also fries, but I


00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:52.580
don't know if it makes like the green seed more of a blue. I haven't heard of anything.


00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:56.980
No, I looked at the products and they can show you.


00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:04.260
Okay, cool. So this part is really just to talk about nomenclature, right? So like we're already


00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:09.060
not that solid on fermentation and we're all ready to jump in and say double.


00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:16.060
And this could, there's an argument for this being a double fermentation, where you're


00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:21.060
doing it in cherry, so maybe a three day fermentation in the cherry, you pulp it, and then you ferment


00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.060
your parchment.


00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:28.060
That could also be a double fermentation, because you are acting on two different steps.


00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:31.060
So I have no problem with somebody saying this is a double fermentation.


00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.060
But these two methods are very different.


00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:37.060
But you could still use the same label for them.


00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:48.060
So could it technically call like, we could call our coffee double fermentation because it came in the truck and carried for a day and then we just start fermenting it again?


00:31:48.060 --> 00:32:03.060
Exactly. Another way that you could use double fermentation is even just in a regular natural where you have a phase of bacteria dominant, you have one type of fermentation, and then you have another phase that's yeast dominant, this could also be a double fermentation.


00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.900
- Everything's a double fermentation.


00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:05.740
- Almost, yeah.


00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:06.560
- Essentially.


00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.400
- Right, essentially.


00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.620
So the point is also it's a completely meaningless term.


00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.340
And I don't know if we're doing ourselves a service


00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.740
or our consumers a service by using this term


00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.740
that is very diluted and means nothing.


00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.140
And the whole point is these three coffees


00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.900
would taste very different.


00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.860
So if you're a consumer trying to buy a coffee


00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.940
that you're like, oh, I tried this one double fermentation


00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:32.540
that I liked, you may never find that flavor again


00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.860
because everyone has their own definition.


00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.220
And the point is, all of these would be correct


00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.820
as double permutations.


00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.660
So for me, naming things by the process


00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.620
is not very helpful.


00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:47.260
It's more of an intellectually fun exercise,


00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.300
but it's not helping producers


00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.300
because it's kind of putting them into these boxes


00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.420
of you have to make these processes.


00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.900
And it's not helping consumers


00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.060
because they're just confused.


00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.700
They're like, "I want to buy a thing that I know I like."


00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.940
So I'm like, "Who are we doing this for?"


00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:05.780
It's a very unhelpful, I think, part of the industry.


00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:10.740
So basically, only natural is one fermentation.


00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:11.740
Only what?


00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.740
Only natural is like one fermentation.


00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.240
Well, no, because this is a natural.


00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.160
This is a dry process.


00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.280
And it is a double, because it's first the bacteria and then


00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.280
the yeast.


00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.540
And the way that Julie is doing hers,


00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:29.540
She has a wet, a submerged cherry portion of her naturals


00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.780
and then it goes to drying.


00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.580
So she definitely has either different microbe dominance


00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.900
at different phases and different literal phases


00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.620
of a wet and a dry.


00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.660
So she could name her coffee a natural,


00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.340
'cause it is, it dried in cherry.


00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.540
She could call it a hydro natural


00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.260
because it had a phase of water.


00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.420
She could call it a submerged hydro natural.


00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.900
you could call it a double hydro natural,


00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.600
she could call it a super natural.


00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:02.000
All of them are correct, but how helpful are they?


00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.900
(audience member speaking)


00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:29.860
[INAUDIBLE]


00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:30.360
Yeah.


00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.860
As long as you have that moisture.


00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.860
And what we saw here, too, is that even


00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:43.860
So even at very little water activity, very little moisture content, these yeast and bacteria are still, most of the yeast are still alive and it's very slow.


00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:48.860
It's very slow. But they're still active, they're still metabolizing, they're still doing something.


00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:59.860
And can you say, if I say for more, we put all these things up, can you like dry them the first few days?


00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:04.860
A lot of yeast and anything still on them?


00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:14.860
That's the, I think, main benefit of the inoculation process that Julie does, is that cherry, this is, so this is the cherry from Giba in Uganda.


00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:23.340
the cherry in a high moisture content just coming in from the field, left alone to its own devices.


00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:28.940
This is all of this mold that grows up. So doing nothing gets you all of this mold. What she's doing


00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:33.500
is she's actually using the yeast in that fermentation. So wherever we have the yeast,


00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:38.860
we don't have the mold. So she's using the yeast as a bio control. So it's like wherever the yeast is,


00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:43.180
it's like I have my table, my reservation, I brought all my friends, like no one else can sit here.


00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:47.980
spots are taken. It doesn't mean the mold's not there. It's like just these spots are taken.


00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.620
So her coffee doesn't look like this.


00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:57.420
Even though she's doing the same thing. She's doing a high moisture cherry, several day


00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.180
contact.


00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:07.660
I'm going to say to your point on double fermentation.


00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:08.140
Yeah.


00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:27.160
[ Inaudible ]


00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:27.860
>> Exactly.


00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.900
We're trying to overcomplicate what is happening.


00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:33.800
The cow has a much more distinct bacteria-dominated phase,


00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.740
acetic acid bacteria-dominated phase, and an yeast phase.


00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:43.740
It's a very clearly marked by temperature, even the most traditional basic producers


00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.740
know this part of it, but we don't try to separate out.


00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.740
It's just fermentation.


00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:54.740
Because to have a successful one, you need that rise of one and then the other


00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.740
to get to your final point.


00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:00.740
So they think of it as one unit, and in coffee we're trying to parse it out


00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.740
and sound really cool.


00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:03.740
[INAUDIBLE]


00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:04.740
Yeah, that's good.


00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.740
I thought we should pick it up as soon as possible


00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:08.740
after picking it.


00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.740
We've already picked it and pointed


00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.740
with it in seconds if we can.


00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.740
So what does that mean for all the dates?


00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.740
So what Cecil is saying is about--


00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.740
the recommendation that you've had


00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.740
is to pick and pulp as soon as possible


00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.740
and to not have any time in sharing.


00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:30.740
So he's asking, where does that fit in in this scheme?


00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:37.740
my preferred method for washed coffees, because any of that time is just something that's


00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.740
hard to reproduce. So it's not that it's going to damage your coffee, it's not that it's


00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:46.740
going to be bad, but my goal is reproducibility. Kind of like a promise to your customer, like


00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:51.740
"I made this thing that you like, and I can do it again." And the way to keep that promise


00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:56.740
is to control as many variables. Now, if you have a customer that's like, "I made you this


00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:01.220
do this one-of-a-kind thing that you can never have again, and you value that, then you would


00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:06.340
keep it in sharing longer, try to do some of these acrobatics, and then give them something


00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:12.020
that is ephemeral. So there's also value to that. I'm not saying there's not. I'm just


00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:18.180
saying, like, what are you trying to do? Do you want consistency, or do you want a uniform?


00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:24.900
And if you want consistency, bulk as soon as possible, control your fermentation, dry,


00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:31.900
So this is to that point of fermentation consistency.


00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:36.900
This is a graph I made up.


00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.900
This is not a study.


00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.900
This is something I like Googled.


00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:47.900
But the idea, just to convey the idea that a traditional wild fermentation,


00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.900
if you remember the graphic of the hands with the coffee,


00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:53.900
and it just has all the rainbow colors, all the microbes,


00:38:53.900 --> 00:39:00.900
So, you know, it's a lot of different things. And I think that's what's so interesting about


00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:07.900
And I'm like, "Okay, I'm going to do this."


00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:16.900
And I'm like, "Okay, I'm going to do this."


00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:24.900
And I'm like, "Okay, I'm going to do this."


00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:28.700
different microbes that are just waiting for their opportunity.


00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.980
It's one degree cooler, this one's going to dominate.


00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:35.340
It's a little more pH, this one's going to dominate.


00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.340
It's a little bit more sugar, this one's going to dominate.


00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.220
What we did with the lactic, so I just


00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.420
kind of made that a hue blue.


00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:46.020
There's just like only blues, only lactic acid bacteria,


00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:50.340
but there's still 50,000 different lactic acid bacteria


00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.580
that are going to be acting.


00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.740
So now your variability is less, but you're still


00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:59.740
going to have variability. You're still going to have a little bit of inconsistency, but you've controlled it a little bit.


00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:09.740
What we're doing with the yeast is we have a clone. We have just one identity, one microorganism that's going to dominate and ferment my coffee.


00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:17.740
That's why in the beginning of the season when it's not that ripe, in the middle of the season when I have a lot, at the end of the season when I have more overripes,


00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:23.340
when it's hot and sunny, when it's cold and there's a bunch of rain, all of these different conditions,


00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:29.340
my coffee is still going to hit the mark. It's going to be really consistent because I'm dominating my fermentation.


00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:38.340
And the point isn't that your coffee should always taste the same, but what we were talking about in the previous group


00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:45.340
is that it's just a tool. Maybe you have one coffee that is particularly troublesome. You have one coffee that just


00:40:45.340 --> 00:41:14.340
And it's not like, "Okay, now I'm a yeast person and I can use yeast on everything." or "I'm a purist, I'm a naturalist, I can't use yeast on anything. Everything is pure from the farm."


00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:17.340
It's just a tool to say, "Where do I need this?"


00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:25.340
Maybe you have just one customer that says, "I would love to buy more of your coffee, but I need it to be an 84, and I will buy a 15-year-old."


00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.340
Just do it with that.


00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:31.340
And maybe you have another customer that says, "I just want 10 bags of something weird this year."


00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:35.340
So it's just like figuring out where it fits.


00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:40.340
I think too often people are just like, "Oh, that's not for me, because I need this other thing."


00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:46.340
And it's like, well, it can--it isn't for everybody, but it can definitely fit in some--in


00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:47.340
some places.


00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:53.340
So we talked about this standardization, this like kind of flattening of the variability


00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:58.340
could be really terrible for--I think it was John Marko's example.


00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.340
He was a small producer.


00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:04.340
He went to the effort to plant ten different varieties, and he keeps them separate, and


00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.340
he marks how many cells in that variety.


00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:14.340
And if you use the same yeast on all of his varieties, he may have a dampening of that difference.


00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:18.340
Which doesn't really help him, because he might put the trouble on all of his varieties.


00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:26.340
But if you're a mill, getting coffee from all corners of the world, and you're trying to make ten containers of consistent coffee to sell to somebody,


00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:37.340
It's helpful that this dampens all of that variability and that you don't have so many different sharp edges.


00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:38.340
Yeah?


00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:45.340
So, would you say, if they would, for example, monitor during the harvest,


00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:49.340
before they would put one vine to the supply point because it's in the system,


00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:54.340
and then they would decide, "Okay, so since March, April,


00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:58.340
we have no weather and we might want to put a few more in the back kitchen


00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:04.340
and use this to get better results in the future?"


00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:07.340
I like that idea of being very targeted, of saying,


00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:13.340
know this particular variety doesn't behave as well or maybe this part of the season. Maybe it takes a while to ramp up.


00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:19.340
Like in the first two months it's just not quite there yet. By peak or end of the season it does really well.


00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.340
Giving it kind of like that head start.


00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:25.340
[inaudible]


00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:29.340
Traditionally, Blue Mountain Tarpon is considered a real wonderful.


00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:34.340
It has to be. Because you only know what you picked after Christmas.


00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:36.340
Only what you picked after Christmas.


00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.340
For Christmas, it was considered limited.


00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.340
Wow!


00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.340
When did that change?


00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.340
Politics.


00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.340
People wanted more coffee.


00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:48.340
People coming into the market


00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.340
and they would


00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:52.340
extend the orders lower and lower


00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:54.340
so they could get more coffee


00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.340
and probably more tea.


00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.340
No, that's okay. So that's really interesting


00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.340
because it's the idea that


00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.340
there's a standard to uphold


00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.340
and knowing that earlier picked, earlier seasoned


00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:10.660
season coffee doesn't quite make that mark. So putting a limit to producers to say only


00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:15.860
after this date, only after Christmas when it's like peak season can you harvest and make what


00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:21.460
we would deem blue mountain worthy. But if you have other tools to say well how do we get this


00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:26.340
earlier season to behave more like peak season, then you have more options, you're not.


00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.340
And they blend as well.


00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.340
Blend the beginning, the end.


00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.340
You know, try and get the beginning of the end.


00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:37.340
Healthy after Christmas, I love that.


00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:42.340
I heard a similar thing in Colombia that they, for a very, very long time,


00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:46.340
wouldn't allow any naturally processed coffee to be exported at all


00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:50.340
because they wanted to maintain the Colombian washed profile.


00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.340
Just like Kenya.


00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:58.340
Kenya has a reputation for being very controlling of what makes it out with the Kenya label.


00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:07.340
Which, in a way, helps producers because you have a high esteem of the country or the region,


00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:13.340
and then it also hurts producers because it limits creativity, growth, innovation, autonomy.


00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:20.340
This is the idea of, okay, we can have historical starters that are decades old, so how long


00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:21.340
can we reuse the yeast?


00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:22.340
This is a sourdough starter that you can have for a very long time or even a commercial


00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:23.340
that you can continually feed.


00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.340
And what I want to share is the difference between these starters and then what we're


00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.340
doing with our yeast packet, our commercial yeast, and why they're different and why you


00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:26.340
can't just keep it forever or even a long time.


00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:27.340
And we talked a little bit about the yeast, and I'm going to talk a little bit about the


00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.340
yeast.


00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:29.340
So, the yeast is a very important part of the process.


00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.340
It's a very important part of the process.


00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:31.340
It's a very important part of the process.


00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:32.340
It's a very important part of the process.


00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:33.340
It's a very important part of the process.


00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.340
It's a very important part of the process.


00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:40.340
commercial yeast, and why they're different, and why you can't just keep it forever, or even a long time.


00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:48.340
And we talked a little bit about it before with like your sourdough, like your goal is the rise and the bubble and the carbon dioxide production,


00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:56.340
which is a primary metabolism. The yeast will do that no problem. But we don't want just that primary metabolism.


00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:00.340
I mean, unless we do, which is, I just wonder what we'd be using it for.


00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:07.340
I'm going to use a brand new one. I'm going to use a brand new one. I'm going to use a


00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:14.340
I would use, you know, the yeast from the grocery store, like, or bread.


00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:23.340
If you just want to remove the yeast, you could do that for three cents.


00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:24.340
If you want to buy SEMA or Intenso or any of these other whinies, you want them for


00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.340
the secondary intact ones.


00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:26.340
You want it for the fruity components.


00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.340
You want it for the organic acid production.


00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.340
You want that part of it.


00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:29.340
And that part of it is what you're going to use.


00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.340
We want it for the fruity components.


00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.340
We want it for the organic acid production.


00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:36.340
We want that part of it.


00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:39.340
And that part of it gets tired.


00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:43.340
So, I was showing this idea of like, living things get old.


00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:47.340
You can't expect a living thing to just be the same constantly.


00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:54.340
So, if you want a tree, if you just want like the shade of a coffee tree,


00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:57.340
then you can have a coffee tree for a hundred years because it will keep making leaves.


00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.340
You will have leaves and you will have branches.


00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.340
And if that's your goal, keep your trees.


00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:07.340
But if you want peak fruit production, if you want that tasty fruit, you have to replant.


00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:13.340
You have to get that new generation if you want that part of its biology.


00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:19.340
So, if you just want mucilin removal, we can do starters for a very long time.


00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:24.340
But if you want to hit that target the way that we are trying with the yeast,


00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:27.340
You gotta make a fresh batch. You gotta get to eating new.


00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:32.340
Because the yeast will only do that secondary metabolism for like 300 generations.


00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:36.340
I don't know, like at some point, they're doing it, they're doing it, they're growing, they're growing,


00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:39.340
and then they're like, "Okay, now I'm pooped out. I'm tired."


00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:45.340
But those 300 generations could take like, I don't know, 40 hours.


00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.340
You have like a really fast turnover.


00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.340
So you can't really keep it around that long.


00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:56.340
The way that I reuse a yeast is I will reuse it like one day to the next.


00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:00.340
So I will, like, let's say we had coffee coming today.


00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:04.340
I would wash that, I would save that mucilage and just add it to my next batch.


00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:12.340
Or if I had maybe like a second tier coffee, if I had something that had less sorting,


00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:16.340
or maybe it was a variety that I didn't love, or I knew it was not my best coffee,


00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:21.620
coffee, I would take kind of the electrode of the second batch of my yeast and use it for that.


00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:29.620
So I've been able to use kind of my liquid three times like at the most, kind of like each time


00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:34.260
going to lesser grade quality if it's still using the yeast, but by that point I'm just


00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:38.580
removing the mucilage. I'm still getting consistency, I'm still reducing defects,


00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:44.180
but that's again using it like within the same week. So I'm not keeping a starter week to week


00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:51.940
the week of this yeast. The other benefit of these starters, because these are not clones,


00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:59.140
these are still a mix of a lot of different species. So when one starts to kind of slack


00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:04.260
off, another one can kind of compensate. But the yeast and the sema, it's a clone. So it's just like


00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:10.020
good inbreeding. You can think about that doesn't work out well long term. Lots and lots of


00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:15.060
inbreeding of a single clone doesn't work. These starters work because they still have a lot of


00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:21.860
diversity. So what makes them last a long time is also it doesn't make them as consistent. We're


00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:30.980
still not hitting that same mark that we are with the clone. Yeah? Regarding uh saying that like you


00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:39.060
could if you just want to remove mucilage you can just use bread yeast. Does bread yeast not have


00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:46.060
I'm trying to understand the difference between the different, like a wine yeast versus a


00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:53.060
bread yeast, and we want the primary metabolites for bread, but does it still produce secondary--?


00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:58.060
Yeah, it does definitely still produce secondary metabolites. I'm not as familiar with what


00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:07.060
they are, or--I'm going to say about the bread yeast--not as familiar with what they are,


00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:10.940
are and they're definitely not as complex because if they were if there


00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:14.700
was that commercial value it wouldn't be selling it to you for like 15 cents a


00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:19.700
sachet so I think that in and of itself is a clue


00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:24.580
but it's not that valuable of like a flavor additive, it's more of a functional yeast


00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:29.140
whereas these other yeast have been developed or selected for these other


00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:34.780
attributes but another one of your questions is what makes them different


00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:40.780
So part of what makes them different is their preference of food, their preference of consumption.


00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:46.780
So our bread yeast, we have our wheat, and with wine yeast we often have glucose.


00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:54.780
So a bread yeast is not giving it fruit sugar, it's not as preferred food, so again you can also stress it out.


00:50:54.780 --> 00:51:00.780
So I wouldn't do a long extended fermentation of that because it's like giving a vegetarian wheat.


00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:07.780
So that's what you're kind of doing to the yeast when you're kind of switching their


00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:16.780
metabolisms, which is why I'm not a huge fan of using beer yeast for coffee fermentations.


00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:22.780
Like coffees and grain, because we have the coffee but what we're fermenting is the fruit.


00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:25.780
And when we use a beer yeast that's not as adapted to consuming the fructose that we


00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:28.780
have in fruit, that's where you have a lot of these alkylators.


00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:36.780
So I've tried a lot of coffees that are fermented with a saison or with another beer yeast that have this cheesy, beany flavor.


00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.780
For me it's just a yeast dress.


00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:43.780
I gave them the food that they didn't love and they worked.


00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:46.780
They're like, "I'll eat it, but I'm not happy about it."


00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:57.780
So in Thailand, this time it's quite popular to culture the yeast from the coffee and try to have their own standard yeast.


00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:04.780
[audience member] But even from what you said, these geese can--I mean, all of them,


00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:11.780
we have the situation and so on, that have the time and the--it means that, I mean,


00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:18.780
even if they have a very good geese, can you just--are they necessarily--do you have time?


00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:22.780
Not necessarily, because when--what you're describing that they're culturing,


00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:25.780
they're still culturing maybe 10 million.


00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:29.100
They're not culturing one and cloning it and having that one.


00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:31.980
So even if they're using the same starter,


00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:35.060
that starter started out with 10 million different bees.


00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.100
So it's not the same situation.


00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:41.180
So I wouldn't be worried about it dying out or moving out.


00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:43.580
I think you still have this situation,


00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:48.220
where you have such a diversity, that it's going to be OK.


00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:48.720
Yes.


00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.940
I don't think that's a problem.


00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.940
But if they try to isolate them,


00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:56.940
I mean, only some species, and working with that?


00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:58.060
- If they were able to do that,


00:52:58.060 --> 00:52:59.980
they'd have to be like, I don't know,


00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.860
five million dollar lab to be able to isolate,


00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:05.700
replicate, and uncontaminated.


00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:08.620
Like, it takes millions and millions and millions of dollars


00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:11.700
to do that work, and it's very difficult.


00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:15.020
And, like I think I mentioned this before with the yeast,


00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:18.900
like, the reactions that it takes to just create biomass


00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.740
and not prevent so that you can build up that yeast,


00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:25.340
release so much energy that they have to be made in Denmark


00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:28.780
so they can use the cooling snow and the water


00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:32.260
to bring down the temperature of these giant bioreactors.


00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:35.260
This is not, you're not gonna get there on accident.


00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:40.260
You're not gonna accidentally only have one blown hornet.


00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:44.140
- What's the (mumbles)


00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:48.340
- It was such a small scale,


00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:52.340
So I did a project with the University of Hawaii this year


00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.340
because I was in a school at the time.


00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:57.340
And so the professor and I were learning


00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:58.340
how to implementations.


00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:00.340
So I gave him some coffee blossoms and I was like,


00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.340
maybe he can isolate some yeast for me,


00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.340
so maybe I could learn that.


00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:06.340
And it started with maybe we could just do bread


00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:10.340
and see if it had a new part on bread flavor.


00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.340
And then it turned into the bread shop


00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.340
couldn't quite make it work because they were super


00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:16.340
busy for Christmas season.


00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:18.340
It really turned into a coffee tree.


00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:23.340
And I think they were just able to do like a soil culture,


00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:25.340
what we do in soil culture, throw it out on a plate,


00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:29.340
isolate, purify it, genetically identify it,


00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:32.340
and then grow up that colony in a broth.


00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:36.340
But that was, I mean, it really should have had funding.


00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:40.340
It's just they had all the tools in the lab to do it already.


00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:45.340
And so it's not like a commercial, probably, venture.


00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:51.340
And it was just sort of like, let's just throw out some fun things that we can do for the sake of doing it and see what happens.


00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:54.340
And then were you able to take my culture to a coffee fermentation?


00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:55.340
Yeah.


00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.340
Cool.


00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.340
Yeah, and we got some cool results from it.


00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:03.340
Like, the cup quality wasn't coffee florals, which is like the region I knew.


00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:05.340
It was like, "Oh, I can make it."


00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:09.340
Even in the fragrance, not only were the coffee blossoms and everything super cool,


00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:14.340
but it just ended up being quite extremely pretty.


00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:16.340
Like, some of them were pretty good.


00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:18.340
Some of them were very bad.


00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:20.340
They were like vegetable and woody.


00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:22.340
So there were four different ones.


00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:25.340
And so it was like an opportunity to fail them.


00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:28.340
And if there was a success, then that's pretty cool.


00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:30.340
So woody is really interesting to me.


00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:33.340
Not when you get like the papery age of coffee,


00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:35.340
but when something is woody, it's something like


00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:37.340
at high thresholds it's woody, and at lower thresholds


00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:43.260
thresholds that woody is actually floral. So I think if you like it's that concentration,


00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:46.300
if you can figure out how to get a lower concentration, I think that woody would turn


00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:50.700
into florals. So like the compound that is jasmine is really close to woody,


00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:57.180
just at like 1x versus 2x of that concentration. So you could still be very close.


00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:04.300
This might be too tangible, but I can't help but like think about like how you're talking about


00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:08.500
like say beer use not necessarily being great.


00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:09.000
Yeah.


00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:09.800
Because it's green.


00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.400
And like feeding things what it needs.


00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:14.200
And then like all the times you talked about how


00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:18.500
raising wine use but we're not using it for like a final beverage.


00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:19.000
Yeah.


00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000
And different things like that.


00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000
And then thinking about things like Rise Up as a Latest Forest


00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.800
being like for soybeans and tempeh.


00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:32.200
And like being something that's actually for the final beans, seeds, tempeh.


00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:38.880
And could there be things like other forms of rhizobus


00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:42.000
olympus forest that could then really be grown


00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.400
in a high humid but dry environment directly


00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.480
on bees that would then directly impact the bees to a greater


00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.800
extent than bees can, which were kind of tangentially?


00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:51.800
Yes.


00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:52.960
I think so.


00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:58.440
And especially the work that I've seen--


00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:00.000
so I haven't done that work myself,


00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.840
but Christopher Barrett has done most of it.


00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:06.840
So his point of view is it should be done on cherry, not on green coffee.


00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:11.840
All of this mold or the koji that we're talking about should be done on cherries


00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:17.840
because it does have this ability to permeate and create much more of an impact


00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:22.840
versus our yeast that we're doing are just on the outside and we're hoping that


00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:27.840
possibly some amount, possibly maybe, gets into the coffee seed.


00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.840
So it is a very indirect--


00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.840
like what we're doing with coffee fermentation


00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.840
is a very indirect process and very imprecise.


00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:38.840
So I think that direction is definitely the future,


00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:43.840
having much more penetration, having much more--


00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:45.840
although, the other thing we were talking about


00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:48.840
was structural integrity.


00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:50.840
So you don't want to mess with the structural integrity too much


00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.840
because then you'll have a great tasting coffee


00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:55.840
that doesn't last at all, that has no shelf life,


00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:00.080
that you have to consume potentially either only in producing countries


00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:04.160
because it doesn't withstand five months of being lost in a container ship


00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:06.160
like somewhere else.


00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.160
So I think there's still a place for that.


00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:11.160
It would just kind of be a slightly different application.


00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.160
But yes, that's a really good point.


00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:15.160
It's like we get so excited about fermentation,


00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:17.160
but it's really minimal


00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:21.160
and it's probably not having as much of an impact as we think it is


00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:23.160
in the way that we're currently applying it now.


00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:29.400
now because it's still very like amateur trying to figure it out. There are a bunch better methods.


00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:34.760
We've had at Black & White in the last year, we've had a number of coffees that like right


00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:41.080
when we first get them in they're super fruity, super floral, like big big flavors and like


00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:47.400
sometimes within two or three months, sometimes even less, they like totally change, totally fall


00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:54.400
and we end up just like, having to blend them out into, you know, some other, other uses,


00:58:54.400 --> 00:59:00.400
um, even though like they were so, so great and different than anything else early on.


00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:06.400
But, yeah, some of the higher impact things just don't stand up for very long. But some


00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:10.400
of them do! And some of them like, have enhanced over time!


00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.400
Yeah.


00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:13.400
And have you noticed, for example,


00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.400
after the roast, the relationship


00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.900
between some of the things?


00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:18.400
Yeah.


00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.400
Yeah, for sure.


00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:21.900
I don't have much of an opportunity


00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:27.400
to taste coffees a lot, like far after post-roast.


00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.900
But there was one, I think-- I've told a couple of people.


00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:33.400
There was a Soudan Roumei that, when we were roasting it,


00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.400
like the weeks that we were roasting it,


00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:36.900
I didn't like it at all and thought


00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:38.400
I didn't like Soudan Roumei.


00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.900
what is this hype that everybody's--


00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:40.740
- Everyone's insane.


00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:41.580
- Right.


00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:43.860
And then I found a bag three months later,


00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:45.200
three months after roast,


00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:47.020
and just was like, I guess I'll brew this.


00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:50.980
And it was one of the coffees that stopped me in my traps.


00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:53.380
It was so delicious.


00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:55.020
Everything that everyone was talking about,


00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:57.020
about Sudanese, but I couldn't get that,


00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:59.980
even just two weeks after roast,


00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:02.180
but I got it three months after roast.


01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:06.460
- So actually this is the end of the section.


01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:07.620
So it's a little bit shorter today


01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.300
so we have to move on to our cupping.


01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.820
So I'm gonna grab the neck and I think we're gonna do it here.


01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:16.780
You may need your help kind of moving tables and moving chairs.


01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.980
But let me grab them and see what's next.
