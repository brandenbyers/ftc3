00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
mystery box. But we all talk about it kind of like all of these other steps.


00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.520
And then drying is pretty straightforward too. You have some


00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.120
wet parchment, their sun comes in, and then you have dry parchment. Like it's a


00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.040
very straightforward step. And roasting is very complicated, but we


00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.320
still have a pretty good handle. If you put in some green coffee,


00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.600
you apply heat, we get this brown stuff on the other side.


00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.760
Like we have a pretty good handle of all of these steps except fermentation.


00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.920
Fermentation for so many people still feels like this black mystery box.


00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.320
And yet we talk about it like all of the other steps.


00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.320
So I think it's just kind of keeping in mind what


00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.120
the place that this has and what we mean by it.


00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.720
This is a mill that I worked at in Rwanda.


00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.120
So this is also to give you an idea of scale.


00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.920
So what we're going to be doing today is in a really small scale.


00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.720
You saw the tank.


00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.720
The tank that we're floating in is a tank that we're going to be fermenting in.


00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.720
But we can also do the same process in this larger size, in these tanks.


00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.720
A big part of it is mixing.


00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:16.720
So being able to get in the tank and move the coffee and being able to get all of that contact.


00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.720
We talked about why we do submerged. We'll talk a little bit more about that later on.


00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.720
But that's also very important.


00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.720
And then you'll also see, we have to cover it.


00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.720
So this is important for me in these larger beneficios, and we'll cover it here too.


00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.720
Not because I want to keep an anaerobic environment and keep the air out necessarily,


00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.720
but this is a big tank and it's all outside.


00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.720
So whatever's flying in, whatever birds or insects or animals or lizards or whatever,


00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.720
we definitely don't want that in our tank.


00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.040
So this is another kind of going back to the idea that we all talk about


00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.760
fermentation but we're not talking about the same things. We're not kind of coming


00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.400
from the same point of view. So the traditional point of a fermentation was


00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.560
mechanical. It was just a function. All I want my fermentation to do is remove my


00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.320
mucilage. And so many people who talk about fermentation, this is what they


00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.680
mean. And so when you tell them that you want an extended fermentation, it's very


00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.000
confusing because the way that we're using it in specialty is okay now it's


00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.240
not traditional it's innovative it's not a mechanical function it's a biological


00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.520
function these these microbes are alive and I'm not doing it to remove mucilage


00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.160
I'm doing it for flavor so we have these very different intentions for


00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.280
fermentation and we're all using the same word and we're all trying to


00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.800
communicate and I've just found a lot of friction in trying to use this one word


00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.960
to talk to all of these different kind of backgrounds and all of these


00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.600
different type of goals.


00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So Cecil is sharing that for in Jamaica for it to be considered Blue Mountain coffee,


00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
for it to have that designation, that label, it had to be grown above 1500 meters.


00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It had to be one variety, Tipica, and it needed to be fermented.


00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
But when they say fermented, they just needed the mucilage to be removed that way.


00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It's like a washed coffee, not a natural.


00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So this was put as like a bar, as a barrier.


00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.960
And that happens a lot in the wine world as well, where having these like


00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.680
restrictions, it can only be this variety, it can only have this name, you must have


00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.560
you know 25 days of skin contact, really helps a region have a name and really


00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.480
gets on that reputation, but it can be really frustrating for producers because


00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.640
you can't break out of that. In a lot of regions in, well in Bordeaux and in


00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.200
Burgundy, they have to cap the amount of wine that they make. They need to


00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.900
keep it scarce, they need to keep it special. So if as a producer you can


00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.940
produce more, you are not allowed to. Because then it would dilute like the


00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.380
specialness of the whole region and you need to stay in line. So in you know


00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.540
initially there's a lot of benefits to having that recognition and then there's


00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.220
also these like handcuffs that come with it where you can't plant another variety.


00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.780
It can't be anything else. Like we've set these parameters and you must stay at


00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.300
this box. So that's tough.


00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:48.980
So I want people to kind of broaden their idea of fermentation to think about intention.


00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.080
What are you doing what you're doing?


00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.300
So if you would, so the traditional, I call that microbial demucilagination, not because


00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.420
I want this clunky name to take on, but because I want to differentiate between fermentation,


00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.100
like microbe function that was just to remove the mucilage and fermentation that has intention,


00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.960
I'm adding a specific micro because I want a fruity profile. I'm doing this on purpose versus I'm just


00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:23.980
letting like removing the mucilage and moving on and then there's another one that I don't think we talked about enough which is


00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.660
Decomposition which is brought. It's like just the doing nothing. It's just the letting the coffee sit in the bags


00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.300
and


00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.300
Yes, these are all technically fermentation


00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.900
Microbial de-mucilagination, a raw ease of fermentation.


00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.380
But I believe that we should elevate the term fermentation


00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.740
to only talk about things that we're doing with intention,


00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.700
not things that are just being neglected


00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.580
or things that we don't really want


00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.780
the function of fermentation.


00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.020
We don't want to add flavors,


00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.300
we don't want to add different general coffee,


00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.100
we just want to remove the mucilage.


00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.140
This, where are we?


00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.980
We're almost at five.


00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.460
This is where the Spanish class stopped.


00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.700
are a very chatty bunch. You guys aren't asking as many questions. How do you feel? I'm willing,


00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.940
we can take a break if this is a lot or we can move a little bit forward. Let's go a little


00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:25.060
bit more. How about we go to 530? Let's go to 530. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so this is what I talk


00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.700
about when I mean fermentation with intention, meaning that we have all of these products,


00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:37.460
you know, grapes and cacao and milk and that we can turn into something else. And so we think,


00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.540
okay, where does flavor come from? And flavor is both processing, like how we get there,


00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:50.580
and the microbes that we took to get there. So one of the issues that I have with coffee is that


00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.620
too often we only think about the process. We think the flavor of naturals comes because I


00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.900
put it on a raised bed, or the flavor of wash comes because I put it in a tank with water.


00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:08.400
And we're only looking at the physical processing, and we're not thinking about what microbes


00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.400
are present in that process.


00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:15.400
So it's a combination of both as to how we get these flavors.


00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:21.120
And then this is just, you know, identifying the actual microbes that give the majority


00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.320
of the flavor to the products that we love.


00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.320
So we'll go more into these later.


00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:36.920
I bring up cacao because cacao and coffee are really like lumped together very frequently.


00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:42.040
They're grown in the same places and there's also fermentation in cacao.


00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.320
But one thing I want to point out is that cacao is very different from coffee, the same


00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:53.280
way that coffee is very different from wine, because the actual seed in cacao is fermented.


00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.880
The inside of the seed is transformed.


00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.080
It changes.


00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:02.320
We can see as it starts out very purple and it's getting more brown.


00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.960
So there is a transformation to the inner meat of the seed.


00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.960
In coffee there's not.


00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:14.640
In coffee, we are fermenting the mucilage on the outside and then hoping that some of


00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.840
that, those components get into the seed.


00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.880
But the seed itself is relatively unchanged.


00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.120
It is not, we're not fermenting the product that we are drinking.


00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:30.520
wine. In all of these other products, the grapes, the grape juice turns into the wine that we drink,


00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.520
right? The cacao actually does become the chocolate. These things are fermented and then we consume


00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:40.920
them. In coffee, the fermentation is like adjacent, it's secondary. It's not the most important thing


00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.480
and I think this is where I have the most trouble, where like this is my field of work and it's


00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.720
fascinating but it's also like not that big of a deal, like it's not that influential.


00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:57.080
And so I've had to like, you know, kind of like temper people's expectation where it's like,


00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.600
this is great, but also calm down. Because like drying is really important and selection and


00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:09.480
variety like fermentation is this like small step in coffee, like in everything else. If we didn't


00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:15.000
have a fermentation, we would never get wine, grapes would never become wine without fermentation.


00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.440
We have wonderful coffee without fermentation. Fermentation is completely unnecessary.


00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.280
and superfluous, but also really fun.


00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.920
So like keeping that in context,


00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.920
like so many people now,


00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.720
I see so much emphasis on fermentation,


00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.360
and I feel like it's very unbalanced


00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.720
because it's something that happens for a few hours,


00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.400
24 hours, 36 hours, even a 50 hour fermentation, okay.


00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.720
But you should be drying your coffee very well.


00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.160
And that, like what you do over three weeks


00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.240
has much more of an impact


00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.920
than what we're doing for 24 hours.


00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.920
So just keep that in mind.


00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:57.920
So yeah, cacao, the actual meat gets changed.


00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.920
You can have unfermented cacao, but that's usually not consumed.


00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.920
That's usually used for like extracts and cosmetics and like other products.


00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.920
I don't think unfermented cacao, yeah.


00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.920
They started making it.


00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.920
Oh, they started making it?


00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.920
In Brazil, it's called ruby chocolate.


00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.920
Ruby chocolate.


00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.920
And it's very sweet.


00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.920
They sweeten the crap out of it, because otherwise it's really like a stringent,


00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:26.920
I'm a bitter of course, but yeah, they, uh, a melter, I think it's XOXO, like the gourmet brand that's sold in the United States.


00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.920
They call it "Ring of Chocolate," but it's this color.


00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.920
It's pink and has more ice cream.


00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.920
It's pink.


00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:33.920
Yes.


00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.920
And why did they do that?


00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.920
What's that?


00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.920
Why did they decide to do unfermented?


00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.920
I have no idea.


00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.520
Well, there's a certain percentage that doesn't ferment.


00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.800
There's just some fermentations that don't go.


00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.960
So I wonder if it's a way for them


00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:57.000
to recuperate some of those beans that would otherwise


00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.680
get wasted or kind of flipping this defect.


00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.320
But I don't see any benefit to not fermenting


00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.840
when you could in cacahuas.


00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.960
Fermented cacahuas are delicious.


00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.440
[INAUDIBLE]


00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.440
It's delicious, actually.


00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:10.940
Yeah.


00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:11.920
So it's like--


00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.640
marketing novelty yeah i guess novelty


00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.440
yeah


00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.640
oh section two never mind let's just end there


00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.480
yeah let's end here we'll we did section one and we'll do this tomorrow morning


00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:34.160
so i think dinner is anybody here


00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.800
dinner might be at 6 30 so i think we have an hour
