00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So there's this trade-off, and I think a lot of times you don't consider your water source


00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
as a really, yeah, water is a source of inconsistency in terms of when you're having the result


00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that you're trying to get and you're having trouble getting that result.


00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Water is, for me, one of the first places to look, to say where's my water coming from,


00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
has my water changed, is there some contamination in my water, what's going on?


00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
what's going on. It's like a clue.


00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Another source of inconsistency is hygiene. It's just not cleaning our tanks. I don't see this enough.


00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I don't see people getting in their tanks, scrubbing with a hydro washer and brushes.


00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This cleanliness is very rare in our coffee industry. One, we talked a little bit about in Colombia,


00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.440
Colombia, there's almost no downtime. If you're just constantly processing, there's no downtime to stop and give everything a good scrub.


00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.560
But even then, we're so used to thinking of coffee as like, "Oh, it's gonna be roasted."


00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.620
So there's no pathogens in it, so you don't treat it in the same


00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.120
category as food.


00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.280
This is something that we're gonna be eating.


00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.920
So if you walk into any winery, any brewery, dairies are some of the cleanest places that you'll ever be because they know


00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.680
contamination has a negative impact on our flavor.


00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.360
And then with coffee, we really have made this connection


00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.360
of lower flavor, lower quality with unclean facilities.


00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.600
Sort of like, oh, we've always done it this way,


00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.400
coffee gets roasted, it's fine.


00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.160
So I think that's one of the biggest leverage points


00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.000
for facilities to improve their quality is just cleaning.


00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.320
It's just having a hydro washer


00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.280
and paying some attention to sanitizing.


00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.160
Not, like I mentioned, I'm not a huge fan of sanitizing


00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.720
cherry, sanitizing with fruit, I don't think that's necessary


00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.640
but I definitely want you to clean your tanks


00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.960
and sanitize your tanks and the pulpers


00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.000
and kind of everything else.


00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.360
So there's like, you know, a bit of a balance


00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.360
with all the things that we've talked about.


00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.040
This is also like what I love,


00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.000
I think the pressure washer is like a really good


00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.800
basic thing for most mills to have,


00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.800
cleaning with water can go a long way, cleaning with pressurized water can go a long way.


00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.800
Neutral detergents, it's really hard in Latin countries.


00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.800
We just have this culture of everything that's soap or laundry detergent or anything has a really strong fragrance.


00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.800
Everything has a really strong fragrance.


00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.800
I mean, but this is like, really easy going away.


00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.800
I mean, you want to make your coffee taste a bit like citrusy.


00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.800
Like lemon lime, citrusy.


00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.800
Lavender flowers. It's very easy.


00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.800
You can mix it a bit


00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.980
We bought some like tissues like Kleenex like facial tissues, and they don't have any like


00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.900
Advertisement that they're scented and when we open the package like Nick and I like


00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.180
Like a sneezing thing because they're so strongly scented and I'm like nowhere does it say they're scented like the default


00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.940
Is you like there's no unscented like the default is you will have a really strong scent


00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.540
So, soaps can be a little bit of a difficulty in Latin countries.


00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.540
But what I like to tell producers is if you have a brewery near you, if you have a distillery,


00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.540
if you have a dairy, they're cleaning their facility, they're cleaning their tanks,


00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.540
they're cleaning their equipment. Ask what they use and see if you can buy some of what they're using.


00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.540
I also like alcohol as like to be cleaning our instruments when we're checking our


00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.540
perceptions, white vinegar.


00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.540
So we don't have to get so intense, we don't have to get so extreme, but just starting


00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.540
kind of that path of cleanliness and sanitization is recommended.


00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.860
Another thing I get asked about frequently is the material of my tank.


00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.980
How does my material impact my fermentation?


00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.500
So you can see that the traditional tau kwe tanks are very porous.


00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.060
They're difficult to clean.


00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.220
And-- are you OK?


00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:34.620
And so a lot of times, yes, these are very--


00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.660
I don't know, traditional, maybe outdated.


00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.740
I think a lot of producers want to upgrade their equipment


00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.820
and the first place they think of is a tank.


00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.220
I'm going to get shiny stainless steel tank.


00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.900
And this can be a really good first step


00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.780
because the smoother the surface,


00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.500
the easier it is to clean.


00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.500
But what I've seen and the mistake that I've seen


00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.620
is that we get new tanks,


00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.740
but we haven't like upgraded our mentality.


00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.020
We haven't upgraded our culture of cleaning.


00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.060
So they buy brand new tanks and just treat them the same


00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.380
as the old concrete tanks that never really get rinsed or washed.


00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.860
So I would rather have a concrete tank that you clean than a stainless steel one that you never clean.


00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.940
And along those lines, this can be an expensive upgrade.


00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.500
So again, I'm still a big fan of plastic.


00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.140
I think plastic is a perfectly reasonable material, plastic bags.


00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.060
It has a smooth surface and the portability,


00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.940
being able to pick up a tank and move it towards the sun,


00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.980
pick it up and put it in the shade or get more of them.


00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.620
Like that flexibility is not as beautiful.


00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.020
It's not as Instagramable, but it's a lot more functional


00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.860
to have multiple of these tanks.


00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.820
'Cause that's another problem.


00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.580
A lot of the times producers have trouble


00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.200
doing experiments 'cause they have like one giant tank


00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.900
or two giant tanks instead of having 20 different


00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.420
barrels or something else that they can do trials in.


00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.980
So that's a little bit difficult.


00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.780
Before-- with producers, before they go to full upgrade


00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.660
to metal, or if plastic is too small,


00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.620
if they need to still do big batches,


00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.500
I do like the method of just tiling your tanks,


00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.820
just reducing your surface area.


00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.260
A tiled tank can sometimes be a much better investment


00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.900
than a stainless steel tank.


00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.060
Also, the way with how coffee's working, being a solid,


00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.060
Those tanks work really well for liquids,


00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.780
but when you have a solid that you have


00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.540
like these much smaller holes,


00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.980
those tanks can be much harder to clean


00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.200
because you're not dealing with a liquid medium.


00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:48.420
So not only do I want you to clean your tanks,


00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.020
but I want you to clean everything that touches the coffee.


00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.340
So we didn't have too much of an upgrade here


00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.700
by going to a plastic tank


00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.820
and then stirring it with a wooden paddle


00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.740
because our wood is not able, it's very porous,


00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.200
and we're not able to clean it.


00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.200
So a lot of times we're just like thinking about the tank,


00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.260
but we're not thinking about everything else


00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.240
that's touching the coffee, the paddles,


00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.400
and like I mentioned, our hands,


00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.380
everything that we're going into.


00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.280
Every opportunity, every opening is a chance


00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.760
to contaminate your coffee, which again,


00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.480
just means it's gonna make it hard to reproduce.


00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.400
Doesn't mean like you're gonna have terrible results.


00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.960
Just means, I don't know if I can hit that target


00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.320
like bullseye every time.


00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.320
So this is another example, it's a plastic barrel,


00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.320
food grade barrel, and then it's got a metal paddle,


00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.440
it's a metal stirrer, which is much easier to clean


00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.280
than wood.


00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.960
And a lot of the times, okay, maybe we clean our tank


00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.680
and we have our great paddles,


00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.160
but we're still not cleaning our surfaces.


00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.520
So this is another mill in Peru.


00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.480
They have the hydro washer, the pressure washer.


00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.440
We clean the tank very well, and it's tiled, it's great.


00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:06.440
But the floor and the walls were very muddy, and so it started to rain, everything was open, and all that mud you can see here went into the fermentation.


00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:14.440
So all of this mud just swept in. So a lot of the times we're really not thinking broadly enough about our cleaning facilities.


00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:23.440
So even when I get to some producers, I'm like, "I clean the tank!" But everything else is still... needs some attention.


00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:30.440
And everything that touches the coffee.


00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.440
All the little critters that have coffee unprotected, all of the birds, and potentially the cats,


00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:42.440
and the moths, and the butterflies, all of these insects are inoculating your fermentation


00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.440
with their own microbes, with their own yeast that they have on their surfaces.


00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.440
And again, it's just a source of inconsistency.


00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.240
It just means maybe that lizard brings the best yeast, but can you trust that lizard to come every time?


00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.240
Will it always be there?


00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.240
Are you ready for the next season?


00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.240
Yeah.


00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.240
Get that, get him on contract.


00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:17.240
So I think because we're just so used to coffee being, I don't know, I see so many people putting up pictures of like coffee dogs and cats on patios and it looks really cute,


00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.240
We're just not used to respecting coffee as a food.


00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.240
And it's just so common how often we show something that would anywhere else would be really gross.


00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.240
But with coffee, it's like, plaint!


00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.240
And romantic!


00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:36.240
What's up?


00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:44.240
Yeah, if you get nothing else from this, get some lizards.


00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.240
Actually this guy I think was from my time in Hawaii.


00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.240
Do you recognize?


00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.240
Yeah, those are fake echoes.


00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.240
It's yours, your employee.


00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.240
I've seen the one on the left in the bag of green coffee.


00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.240
Oh, Carolina.


00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.240
It went all the way to the green coffee, but yeah, it was dried out.


00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.240
Well, yeah.


00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.240
But yeah.


00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.240
Same as that.


00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.240
Burn and work.


00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.240
Huh?


00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.240
Burn and work.


00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.240
Yeah.


00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.240
So is that a part of coffee free business?


00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.240
[LAUGHTER]


00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.240
Sorry, a little bit of umami.


00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.740
A little earthy.


00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.960
So we've talked about this a little bit already,


00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.200
about why I cover the fermentations.


00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.760
So covering it is homogenizing the environment


00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.720
and also preventing any potential contamination.


00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.280
So whether we have the big tanks, and like I said,


00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.560
covering it on the surface is a little bit more effective


00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.200
than just putting a lid on top.


00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.520
And in this situation, with all of these plastic barrels,


00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.840
they each had their own little plastic lid.


00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.880
So it depends how much effort you want to do.


00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.400
If you want to do small batches or have the opportunity


00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.520
to do those larger batches.


00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.960
But even still, covering every single one is just a good idea.


00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.560
Just safe practices.


00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:10.480
So this is another idea of our scale really


00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.000
impacts our results.


00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000
The same way in roasting, what you do for a sample roast with 50 grams is not what you


00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
do for a 200 kilo batch or a 500 kilo batch.


00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
The size of your sample is really going to affect the kinetics.


00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
How much heat it takes up, how much energy is needed to transform it.


00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
This is also true for our fermentations.


00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
So the biggest mistake I see producers making is they do a bucket trial, they love it, and


00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.280
They say, now I need five tons of this.


00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:45.360
And they apply the same rules to the bigger fermentation.


00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.120
And it doesn't translate.


00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.520
Our sample roast doesn't translate


00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.720
to our full-size roast.


00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.640
And our bucket trials don't translate


00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.080
to our big fermentations.


00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.360
So a lot of times for me, bucket trials


00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:03.000
are not super useful if my goal is to do big fermentations.


00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.680
So when I work with clients, I'm like,


00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.480
what is the final size you want to make?


00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.280
And we start with that.


00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.000
And because I know that I'm not going to ruin their coffee,


00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.120
I know what to look for, we can get away with it.


00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.680
Our trial is 10 tons.


00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.000
Our trial is the size that you're


00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.480
going to do so that we can replicate those results.


00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.440
And the other reason why we really


00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.400
can't replicate a bucket to our full-scale tank


00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.440
has a lot to do with the geometry


00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.160
and the configuration of these tanks.


00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.120
[DOG BARKING]


00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.600
[DOG BARKING]


00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.600
Oh, dog.


00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.080
[DOG BARKING]


00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.560
[INAUDIBLE]


00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.040
[INAUDIBLE]


00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.440
So if we look at the shape of this,


00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.240
like our surface area is very small and our volume is large.


00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.920
There's a lot of coffee that is in one environment compared


00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.560
to the thin surface area on top.


00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.720
Compared to a traditional coffee tank,


00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.360
there's a swimming pool that has a huge surface area and very


00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.880
little volume.


00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.880
So in this case, that whatever 10%, 5% of the coffee


00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.600
is in a slightly different environment.


00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.680
Maybe it's a little drier, maybe it's a little warmer,


00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:18.520
but most of my coffee is in a very similar environment.


00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.480
In my super big tank, when I have all of the surface area,


00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.600
then a lot of my coffee is very different


00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.360
from the rest of the coffee.


00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.520
There's a lot more difference


00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.200
between all of this coffee surface


00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.960
and whatever is underneath whether it's temperature,


00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.880
the bottom is more moist, the top is more dried out.


00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.120
There's a lot more inconsistency in this geometry.


00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.620
And the other thing, especially with these tanks


00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.240
that are open and exposed,


00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.720
then, I mean, you can see where that guy's standing.


00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.400
It starts to rain, and then it starts to rain into my tank,


00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.880
and then it starts to get more wet,


00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.080
or it starts to, a cloud comes in,


00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.440
and I get a lot more humidity.


00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.160
Or conversely, I get a lot more wind,


00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.880
and so I'm drying out the surface of my coffee,


00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.880
Or the sun, we saw another one where the sun was shining on one of the other surfaces,


00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.880
so it starts to heat up a lot more on top and underneath.


00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:16.880
So this tank is not ideal for consistent batches of coffee.


00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:22.880
And a lot of the times that's also why we can't translate one thing to the other.


00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.880
So when you're going from, "Okay, I did a bucket trial, and now I need to make it bigger,"


00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:34.880
So, I think, think about how you can replicate some of the environment, some of what that


00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.880
small batch experience on a larger scale.


00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:43.880
Don't just think about, now I just add volume and add more yeast and add more water.


00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.880
But sometimes we do have to do bucket trials.


00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:52.880
So, I was in Brazil two harvests in a row, and this producer wanted to try, he had, he


00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.760
like 10 different yeasts that he wanted to try and he was making new, he was growing


00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:01.080
new varieties. He had some Bobata, he had some Ubonobo, and he just had some others


00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.680
that he hadn't tried before. So he really wanted to do a lot of permutations. We did


00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:11.160
like 22. We couldn't do 22 big tins because we didn't have that much cherry and we didn't


00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:16.080
have that much time. So sometimes you have to do bucket trials. So the first year we


00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:21.680
did a whole bunch of different bucket trials of different varieties mixed with, so we take


00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.760
one variety with five yeast, and then another variety


00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.960
with the five yeast, and then another variety with the five


00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.000
yeast to see which one behaved better,


00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.680
which one was a better pairing.


00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.080
And once we found that size--


00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.280
or sorry, once we found that match that we liked,


00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.800
say we liked sima with obata, or we like intensa with mugunoko,


00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.520
whatever it was, then we did have to scale it.


00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.800
So using my parameters, using our curves,


00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.960
and say, how do we make it similar?


00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.160
You're able to take that small bucket


00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.760
and get to the very large size.


00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:01.800
So this gentleman is standing on a bucket inside of the tank.


00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.840
So that is actually another, however deep.


00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.120
That is, it's a good amount of coffee.


00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.360
And following our curve, following our parameters,


00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.320
first this happened, and then we had this interchange.


00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.960
And you were able to replicate small buckets


00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.000
onto the big scale.


00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.160
So it's definitely possible.


00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.560
It's just not as direct a translation.


00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.040
So you can do it.


00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.480
Again, by following the behavior,


00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.720
following how it behaved with the little bucket


00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.680
and how I can make it bigger.


00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.680
Do you have any results?


00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.160
How did you target it?


00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.640
I mean, like, were you being very inconsistent


00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.120
with the new results?


00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.120
Or do you have the biggest impact?


00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.120
Because I guess you could have different styles of normal mutations


00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.120
with what is, so like a very small,


00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.120
more powerful, bigger, bigger, bigger,


00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.120
similar or different?


00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.120
Um, it's a good question.


00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.120
They were, it's sort of like,


00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.120
it was close enough that it still gave a good result.


00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.120
So, it was also about being flexible, like,


00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.120
maybe there was this particular profile,


00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.120
and we didn't exactly match that profile,


00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.120
but we got good results that we could sort of move forward.


00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.120
So at that point it wasn't necessarily matching the exact results,


00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.120
it was about just doing it well.


00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.120
Pairing.


00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.120
Pairing, yeah. Sort of like...


00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:32.120
If you have to work with big tanks, like something like this,


00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.120
so basically I think the biggest thing that you want to play with,


00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.120
or you push to play with, is the temperature.


00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:47.120
Us playing with water, so adding more cold water or adding more warm water is the best way to...


00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.120
That is the easiest. Temperature is the easiest lever to pull.


00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.120
And heating up water to try and match a smaller...


00:17:54.120 --> 00:18:00.120
Or cooling water and adding cold water to the fermentation is the easiest lever to pull.


00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:05.120
But do we not put it in the concentrations or something like that?


00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.120
No, because it's still the same amount of water, just the temperature of the water is different.


00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.120
No, but we... Why it's still the same?


00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:21.120
Because we have the tank with the cherries and with some more water just to make it homogeneous.


00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:26.120
And then we dump a bit extra water inside, like cold water to either...


00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:31.120
No, so I wouldn't start with water and add cold or hot water.


00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:36.120
I would first heat or cool my water and add that water to my cherries.


00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.120
So I wouldn't add any extra water.


00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.120
You mean you take something out of the tank?


00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:45.120
No, I would start with the water and the temperature that I want.


00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.120
So let's say it's really cold, and I did do this in Brazil at a different place.


00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.120
So it was a pretty cool environment.


00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.120
And the client didn't...


00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.120
He just bought yeast that he thought sounded interesting.


00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:06.640
I looked at the instructions of the yeast and said it is a red wine yeast that needs to be at like 27


00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:14.160
but our environment was at like 10 celsius. So we built up the yeast and then it was in the like


00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:20.720
you know those water cubes the one that I showed that's how I said it was one of these.


00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:28.960
So we had one of these tanks and I first we pulped the coffee into it and then we warmed up water we


00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:36.240
heated water to like 25 and then added the water at 25 to this tank to the submerged level.


00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:43.040
And because the fermentation is so vigorous it was able to maintain that temperature for the


00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.440
rest of the time but if I had just added water it would have been at 10 and it may have never


00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:52.400
taken off. So at that point I don't touch it again. I don't add more water or take out more


00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.680
water or do anything. My first one yeah because then you would be diluting. It's just my first


00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:05.120
introduction is with warm water. Yeah, but my question is when you started it, for example,


00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:10.720
a day later, would you see that it's like really drastically went down the temperature?


00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:17.280
How can you play around with the big volume, like big tanks?


00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:23.360
It's really hard because what we did in Brazil was we did it with the warm water,


00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:30.960
but the night was so cold and it was outside so then what we did is you can see this has wheels


00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.560
or like a forklift so then we physically moved the tank into the sun we warmed it up a little


00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.120
bit and then we brought it inside so that it could ferment inside instead of being outside


00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.680
exposed so when you have a concrete tank you have a lot more difficulties


00:20:45.680 --> 00:21:08.240
[ Inaudible ]


00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.280
>> Exactly.


00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.180
I'd rather not.


00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.140
So if we have this, when we have these tanks,


00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.420
I know that this can fit like 600, 700 kilos.


00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:19.500
And that's the batch that I want to get.


00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:23.580
If for some reason I only have 200 kilos,


00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.680
I use a different tank.


00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.700
And then fill that up to the maximum.


00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.580
So I would rather change my vessel and fill it up


00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.420
than to have one vessel and just keep changing.


00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.740
Because every time you change the volume,


00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.020
you're changing that surface area to volume ratio.


00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.020
So I would rather have a variety of tanks.


00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:47.020
So this one is only for 600 and above.


00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.020
If I have 400 or less, I have a different tank.


00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.520
I have the black one.


00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.020
If I have less, I have the red one.


00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.520
Sometimes I think for babies, right,


00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:01.020
it's even more, even more important to have a good volume for the--


00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.020
Yes.


00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.020
--the population and--


00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.020
Exactly.


00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.020
Yes.


00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.020
That's really important.


00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.940
And that's one of the things that Alejandra brought up.


00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.540
She makes really good coffee.


00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.120
She has really good practices.


00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.700
One of the things that she just knew to do


00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.480
is always fill the tank to the same level.


00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.780
And if she can't fill that level,


00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.860
she uses a different tank.


00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.580
And I think that a lot of producers


00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.660
have variability for that because they just,


00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.780
they have one tank and then whatever comes in


00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:29.620
goes in that tank.


00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.100
Whether it's 100 kilos or 1,000 kilos,


00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.180
they use the same tank.


00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.280
And the coffee turns out very differently.


00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.580
So plastic was your hat.


00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.560
And it's not.


00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.020
[CRASHING]


00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.000
[LAUGHTER]


00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:44.500
Running start.


00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:52.660
So yeah, so tank material is important,


00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.320
but also how much you fill your tank


00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.820
goes a long way into consistency.


00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:03.780
So this is just following the behavior.


00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.740
If I want to translate it-- yeah, Sasan?


00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.340
So if I remember, the first time you see, it was 5 gallon buckets.


00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.940
It was 5 gallon buckets.


00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:16.340
And that took 30 kg, which is one unit of 4 buckets.


00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:21.940
So if I did one unit or 10 units, they would all be full to the brim.


00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.340
Now that I switched to the blue drum, I cut that in half.


00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.940
Sometimes it's only 3/4 of the way.


00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:34.540
So should I get more drums and maybe make different layers,


00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.340
One for five boxes, one for ten boxes.


00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.340
That's what I would like.


00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.340
Rather than more buckets?


00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:44.340
I like larger units to that point.


00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:49.340
So like not so large that it's ten tons in like a concrete tank.


00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:54.340
But for you, the bigger you can make it,


00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.840
so I would rather you have one drum than three buckets.


00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.840
With different heights, yes.


00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.840
Yeah.


00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.340
Because again, the more kind of a unit you have,


00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:11.340
As much as a cylinder or cube, you can make your fermentations, I think that geometry is really good.


00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:21.340
And the bigger it is, if you can have one that's 60 kilos instead of 230, you will have more mass, you'll have more energy.


00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.340
I just like that better.


00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:30.340
And you're only monitoring one fermentation instead of taking two cages at two temperatures and making sure they match.


00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:36.340
Like if you can just consolidate it to 160 or even 190 instead of having buckets, it'll be easier.


00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:45.380
Only if you have enough coffee to fill the truck, otherwise you go back to your buckets.


00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:54.820
The limit I would say is whatever you can mix. So that, the thing that I showed with Sebas,


00:24:54.820 --> 00:25:04.820
This guy, this is, he can do 700 kilos of colt coffee, so over a ton of cherry. 700 kilos of colt coffee in here.


00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:10.820
And Cebaz is strong enough and tall enough that he can still mix this entire unit.


00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:20.820
So I would rather him mix one 700 kilo unit than have three barrels and be monitoring three different permutations.


00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:26.260
But if this is so big that it is really hard, like I couldn't mix that by myself. He can.


00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:35.820
So I would do, if I was by myself and I had nobody to help me, I would do two barrels that I could mix really well and split it into two presentations.


00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:39.140
This might also be relevant to your experiment setup.


00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.140
Yeah, super cool.


00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:52.940
So this is just my little shorthand that's in your books of like what I like to measure.


00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:57.940
In my environment, I like to get ambient temperature and relative humidity.


00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:03.940
Kind of for what we saw before where if you have coffee exposed, which we're not going to anymore,


00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.940
but if you do or you don't have plastic, you know your relative humidity.


00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.940
Was it a really wet day? Was it windy? Was it dry?


00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.940
For the cherries, I like to measure the color.


00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:18.940
obviously what percentage is in my range, like what percentage is in my acceptable range.


00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:24.940
So when I'm cupping my coffee at the end and I like some attributes, I want to be able to go back and say,


00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:31.940
"Wow, this day we had 85% of our cherries in an acceptable range compared to this coffee that's like,


00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:39.940
"Oh, and it was at 60%." So maybe that will guide my, but again, that's like a decision you make later.


00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:46.940
So, I'm going to measure my pH.


00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:51.940
I'm going to measure my pH.


00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:57.940
I'm going to measure my water.


00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:04.940
I'm going to measure my water.


00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:09.940
This is whole coffee, so this would be in the fermentation.


00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:14.940
My delta, I don't necessarily look at a starting brix or an ending brix.


00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.940
I look at my delta. How did it change?


00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.940
So that was before. Like what path did it take?


00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.940
Did I go fast? Did I go slow? Like how much?


00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.940
I look at my curve.


00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.940
And the same is true for my brix.


00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.940
I don't really care. I don't have a target.


00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:33.940
I don't want to like always get to 10 brix or always 8, anything like that.


00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.940
What I care about is how did it change?


00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.940
What's my delta?


00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.940
And then I look at my time and my temperature.


00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.940
What rivers?


00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.940
And then obviously moisture content.


00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.940
We want to know for our green coffee and if you can


00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.940
water activity.


00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.940
Exporters do it. Some roasters


00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.940
have the machine. Importers do it as well.


00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.940
Producers are able


00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.940
to measure their water activity


00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.940
because it's a very expensive


00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.940
machine, but I think it's technology that's better.


00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.940
We're going to be coming out with cheaper models.


00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.940
And we'll talk more about what I'm going to do.


00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:18.940
So what is your deal on the change, you know, on the delta?


00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.940
Like, to get fast, slowly?


00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.940
To know what it is. Again, nothing is good or bad. Nothing is ever good or bad.


00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.940
It's just, can I get it again?


00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.940
Just know what it is and try at the end and see.


00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:34.860
know what it is and try at the end and then your flavor will say I liked it or


00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:39.940
I didn't like it and then you can know I can avoid this curve in the future or I


00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:44.180
want to replicate. So now it is for repetitively? Yeah.


00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:49.100
So it's not for getting the best flavor or for avoiding a bad flavor it's just


00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:55.380
saying wow I hit the bullseye and I want to hit it again what can I do?


00:28:55.380 --> 00:29:00.380
that are monitoring how you can prepare these to a roasting court.


00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.380
Yes. Exactly.


00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:09.380
So this is just a reminder, or I think some people still have this idea,


00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:14.380
we talked about it earlier, that what matters is the variety and the roasting.


00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.380
That these two things are where the flavor comes from,


00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:23.380
and then processing is either something painted on top or something extra,


00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.380
So this is just a reminder that all of these things matter.


00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:25.380
The variety absolutely matters.


00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.380
The processing influences the flavor and the roasting matters as well.


00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:27.380
All of these things combine to give you the whole picture.


00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.380
And what we were sort of talking about sugar earlier, that most of our seed is 50% carbohydrates.


00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.380
It's too often we use sugar and carbohydrates interchangeably.


00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.380
That makes it kind of confusing.


00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.380
We should be talking about carbohydrates and sugar.


00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.380
And so we're going to be talking about carbohydrates and sugar.


00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.380
And so we're going to be talking about carbohydrates and sugar.


00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.380
And so we're going to be talking about carbohydrates and sugar.


00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.380
And so we're going to be talking about carbohydrates and sugar.


00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:36.380
And so we're going to be talking about carbohydrates and sugar.


00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.380
And so we're going to be talking about carbohydrates and sugar.


00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.380
And so we're going to be talking about carbohydrates and sugar.


00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:43.380
And what we were sort of talking about sugar earlier,


00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:47.460
that most of our seed is 50% carbohydrates.


00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.660
It's too often we sugar and carbohydrates


00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.460
like interchangeably, that makes it kind of confusing.


00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.860
Like we should be talking about carbohydrates


00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.580
as like carbon building blocks.


00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.680
The thing that I think is interesting


00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.860
in where I pulled some of these numbers


00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.340
is that the sucrose is three to 8%,


00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.800
which seems like a small amount,


00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.880
Meaning that in different varieties,


00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.800
the sucrose content can vary from three to 8%.


00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.320
But that's actually a lot.


00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.920
Like the fact that some varieties have three


00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.760
and some have eight,


00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.480
like some varieties genetically have


00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.280
almost three times more sucrose available.


00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.780
And so if you have one of those,


00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.520
compared to one that's much lower,


00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.120
your processing is only gonna go so far.


00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.280
There's a limit to how much your processing


00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:41.920
might compensate for a lower, I don't want to say bad, but just for like a lower for a different


00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:50.800
you know quantity of sucrose. So genetics definitely, your plant genetics really matter


00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:56.400
with your flavor. And then other way around as well you can go if you for example calibrate your


00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:02.400
recipe is about 3% sucrose coffee and we use the population of 8%


00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:07.400
so we're basically speeding up the process


00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.400
adding more material to be involved


00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.400
I don't know if it works


00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.400
Don't you think that it can just go further than for example


00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.400
if you calibrate it on food


00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.400
Well, I think this is where we're getting two things confused


00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.400
because I'm talking about what's in the seed


00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.400
kind of like what's found inside


00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:29.200
And when we're doing our fermentation, it's just the mucilage on the outside.


00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:34.900
So it's not that one variety has three times more sucrose available in the mucilage,


00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.300
and therefore the fermentation would be like faster.


00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:42.800
I'm talking about like the sucrose that's in the seed that we don't have readily available.


00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:47.100
We don't have that like immediate access to in our fermentation.


00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:51.300
It's just the genetics of the fruit.


00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.700
Yeah?


00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.700
Can you touch on the flavor of cherries from the tree?


00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:01.700
It seems to be somewhat sweet and somewhat not so nice.


00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.700
Some are sweet and some are not as sweet.


00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:08.700
And the other thing that's really helpful about this study that we're going to talk about next


00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:16.700
is that there are some flavor precursors that they find in green coffee that survive roasting,


00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.700
that don't get transformed, that don't get chemically changed.


00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:24.700
It's the same compound in the green seed as it is in the roasted coffee.


00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:30.700
So there is some evidence that when you taste the geisha cherry,


00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:35.700
when you taste those flavors that are like peachy or...


00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:41.700
Yeah, that those same flavors survive in after the roasting process.


00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:47.700
But it's, I think it's so kind of far or it's hard to say that the flavors that we taste in the fruit


00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.460
are going to end up in the ground.


00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:53.020
Some of them will, but because coffee is so transformed


00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.020
in its processing and its roasting,


00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:58.140
it's really hard to know how much is going to survive


00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.540
and how much will be transformed.


00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.140
So one of the kind of, what's it called,


00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.020
topics that we were talking about before


00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:09.300
is the concept of just having more stuff.


00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.660
If you have more stuff,


00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:13.940
then you either have more stuff to play with


00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.940
or more stuff to lose.


00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.400
And so in our fermentation, when we're getting more stuff


00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.940
and we're creating more compounds,


00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:25.120
it gives you more of that opportunity to age your coffee,


00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:29.040
age more gracefully, or more material


00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.400
to potentially transform during the roasting


00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.580
to make a more complex coffee.


00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.880
So it's just like having more building material.


00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.120
It's like I have three trucks of lumber and nails


00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.920
and I'm gonna do something with it,


00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.720
versus I just have like a wagon full of like


00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.720
some wood and some nails.


00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.720
Like, I can make more things.


00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.720
Doesn't mean I will, I just can.


00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.720
Potential.


00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.720
Yeah.


00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.720
More potential.


00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.720
Exactly.


00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.720
More potential.


00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.720
So this is just a study that really reinforces, like, sometimes we're like, we don't know what's true,


00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:04.720
and we don't know what's anecdotal, and it is true that in the fermentation, we make precursors,


00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:10.720
we know they get into the seed, we know that they can change our flavor.


00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:15.600
What we don't know very well is how, like the mechanisms, the transport mechanism of how these


00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:23.360
compounds get into the seed is still up for debate, but they can find them. They test the green coffee,


00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.800
they find the signature, they taste the roasted coffee, they find the signature,


00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:32.480
and we know this happens. There's still more work to be done on how this happens.


00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.280
So really quickly to touch on drying.


00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:46.600
These are just two


00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.240
two pictures of the same patio in Parma del Salvador.


00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.880
And so it has a more


00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:58.720
more traditional kind of surface like the clay tiles that get very hot.


00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:03.040
So in order to try to improve their processing, they put these raised beds


00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:11.640
for to get more airflow, to get the cherries off of that really, really hot surface.


00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:15.720
And you can see that some of the top ones are shading the bottom ones.


00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:20.120
So it's just an effort to improve quality by reducing the temperature.


00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.160
And I think this is a really, really overlooked part of coffee.


00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.520
I think so often we want to improve quality with fermentation,


00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.920
when you can keep your fermentation the same and just improve your drying


00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:36.600
and get much more like return, like much more bang for your buck on better drying.


00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:43.400
Because drying is a place where you can really destroy a lot of the good work that you've done


00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:49.800
before with too fast and too hot drying. What you do in the tank, I mean the whole point is that they


00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:56.680
are delicate complex volatiles that are going to delight you. So if you do a really hot fast drying


00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.180
and you're eliminating those volatiles.


00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.840
You're heating them up and they're escaping.


00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:05.800
So yes, we do work on fermentation,


00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:10.420
but drying is really often the key to higher quality.


00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.400
And just lowering your temperature,


00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.400
being more gentle, backing off, can go a long way


00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.960
towards quality.


00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.000
So another thing that I think a lot of times


00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.920
we don't really realize is we think, OK, I've done my job.


00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:30.240
the fermentation's over, the coffee's drying, it's fine.


00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.240
Not realizing that, okay, the microbial charge


00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.720
is still there, the microbes are still,


00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.640
especially on a natural, the microbes are still there.


00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.080
If you've got humidity, if you've got like humidity


00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:46.080
plus time, you've got a risk of some change.


00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.240
So the more time you have, or the more humidity you have,


00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.600
the more opportunity for the coffee to change,


00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.760
to be different.


00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.880
And again, it's not that it's gonna be worse,


00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.640
that it's going to be hard to hit that target and promise your customer I can do this again.


00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:03.040
I'm like, I don't know if I can. I don't know what happened during that drying.


00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:11.680
So what we really want to do is, the thing that they used to say about fermentation is


00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:17.600
you can't improve a coffee, all you can do is ruin it. I don't think that's true of fermentation,


00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.560
but right now, and I can probably eat my words and like whenever there's new research, but for now,


00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:28.920
I think drying really is that point where we can't necessarily improve a coffee. We're just preserving or ruining it.


00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:34.560
So not true fermentation, but definitely true drying.


00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.000
Until proven otherwise.


00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.800
We definitely want to be slow enough to be gentle.


00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:48.680
So we like I said we want what we were doing in this example of getting the coffee off of the ground, more airflow,


00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:53.360
having this metal structure on top so they can put shade and protect it from the heat.


00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:59.360
But I think there is a thing it's too slow, too gentle. Having extended moisture contact


00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:04.240
is what we've seen in some other pictures of fungal growth. We can definitely


00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:12.080
invite other microbes to the party. These are sort of the goals when I think about drying.


00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:18.960
What are the guidelines? So here is an example of coffee at 40 Celsius. You can see the


00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:25.680
cellular structure still stays intact and 60 that structure has been burst so


00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:32.520
that the integrity is no longer there so high temperature definitely destroys


00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:38.040
structure we know that this is true it's not an opinion the opinion is kind of


00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:44.600
how much is too slow and how much is too fast my opinion is that in less than six


00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:55.600
I've seen it's very difficult to dry a coffee in like five days in a gentle way. I feel like if you're drying in five days, you're probably using too much heat. You're probably going too fast.


00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:11.600
And then on the other side, I don't think that we need to extend the fermentation so long. I don't think that 25 days, like, I was in, in Rwanda, and they were purposely building, let me have a picture of it,


00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:17.600
These large structures, so that they can dry their coffee completely outside of any UV


00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.600
contact, completely in the shade, so that they can extend it to five weeks.


00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:26.600
And, just sort of like, I mean their quality was great, but I felt like they could have


00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.600
gotten really great quality in maybe three weeks.


00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.600
I don't think they need to wait for five.


00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:38.600
What do you think about the combination of drying and storing and drying?


00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:42.520
I think that's really key. I think that's really important, which is why I think


00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:46.680
you know less than six days is too slow because it doesn't give you the chance


00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:51.960
to dry rest, dry rest. I think that cycle is really important for quality.


00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.960
What do you think about mechanical dryers?


00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:59.160
Love them. I love them so much. There's a whole section on mechanical dryers. Big fan.


00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:04.640
So this is just to show you that there are guidelines like there is too hot,


00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:11.640
And then we're just bursting the cells and releasing the contents, then we're not going


00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:16.640
to be able to proceed them in the cup.


00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:23.640
And I can't tell you how many times we go through the effort of doing a fermentation,


00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:28.640
do the trial, and then no one pays attention to the drying.


00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.640
It was like forgotten or just went too quick.


00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.280
And they're like, "You dried it at 60 in three days!"


00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.080
Because they were so excited to try the trial.


00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.480
They dried the coffee really fast


00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.680
so that they could taste the results


00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.520
and kind of ruined the experiment.


00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:45.080
- When there's someone who, above us,


00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.600
kind of at higher altitude,


00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.240
commenced washing, brings it down,


00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:53.680
and puts it on a tennis court in Houston.


00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.520
- Like on a dark--


00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.320
- On a dark, green tennis court.


00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.160
(laughing)


00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.160
It's like cooking.


00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.160
- Yeah, pre-roasting.


00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.000
- Pre-roasting.


00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.000
This is another example of the same. This one is 40 and this one is 60.


00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
And you can see in the 40, like the oils are preserved.


00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
And then on the 60, the structure has burst. The oils are exposed to oxygen.


00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000
And that's when the coffee is granted, you know, starting to fade quality.


00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Your coffee is so neat.


00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Wary of your temperature is when we're drying.


00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:41.000
So this is my client. He's one of my like star pupils. I adore him. If you listen to the podcast, Rolando is the one who was getting the feedback that he had the fishy smell, the fishy aroma in his coffee.


00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.000
And I just couldn't figure out why it was fishy. I went to his mill like three times. This is the first time. I've been there three times.


00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:55.000
But it was because before he bought the mill, they were raising fish. It was a fish farm.


00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
So they used the giant tanks to contain fish for like decades.


00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000
And then he bought it, fermented his coffee in there.


00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Like not knowing what the previous history was.


00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
He was like, "Oh, this mill is for sale."


00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
And then he was starting to ask around, like the history of the mill,


00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
and they told him, "Oh, there used to be a fish farm."


00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:22.000
So he's somebody who was previously selling all of his coffee commercially to the El Salvador


00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:31.000
commodity market and was really interested in changing into specialty.


00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
And so when I met him, his ratio was like 80/20.


00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
80% of his coffee was commercial and 20% of it was good enough to sell to specialty,


00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.680
which is like, basically, like highly sorting coffee,


00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.240
you can kind of like push it in that direction.


00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.640
So after he, like I said, he implemented better drying,


00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.560
he's the one who had the 20,


00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:56.320
actually he bought 100 plastic barrels


00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.360
and was doing like all of these small fermentations,


00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:02.160
taking his time, and he was able to flip that ratio


00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.760
to 80% of his coffee is now specialty,


00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.440
and 20% of it he just sells on the commodities market.


00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.800
But he did a lot of work over many years,


00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:31.800
But he got it. He's like, no, I want to do this. This is Rolando again. He does a lot of coffee. It's volume coffee. He's got a lot of space. But something really simple to lower his temperature is just putting on a shank cloth and being able to pull it out and retract it and just make sure that his temperature wasn't going above 40.


00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:36.800
What do you think about walking on the parchment and the friction between the two?


00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:42.800
I don't love walking on the parchment. I've seen much worse in Guatemala.


00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:48.800
They have to move it like full tractors, just like driving over the coffee.


00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:54.800
So it's not my favorite practice, but at some point it's like that diminishing return.


00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.800
It would be so difficult not to do it this way.


00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.800
But I'm okay with it.


00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.800
I saw even motorbikes.


00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:04.800
Motorbikes?


00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.800
Yeah.


00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.800
Yeah, the coffee does get beat up a lot.


00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.800
So something like this.


00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:16.800
So you think about the weight of a human man walking on the coffee.


00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:21.800
But then you also have something like a, I don't know, 80 quintal guaviola.


00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.160
and the weight of that much coffee


00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:27.600
kind of continually smashing on that.


00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.120
So it's hard to be gentle,


00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.400
and it is something I definitely try to think about.


00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.520
- But what about contamination on the boots?


00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:35.920
- Definitely.


00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.600
Contamination on the boots, I think it's,


00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.200
I definitely wish you weren't walking on top of it.


00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:44.960
But the drier it gets, the less opportunity.


00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.800
But there's always there, it's always there, yeah.


00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.480
- When you go to commercial factories,


00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:56.480
I think that's good practices and that's a good idea.


00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:01.480
It's a good thing to adopt.


00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:06.480
This, I don't know why it didn't come out.


00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:11.480
So this, you know, like two methods.


00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:16.480
I use my temperature gun and I like to get the surface.


00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:22.720
that got cut off. So two things, using the temperature gun like we did for during COVID


00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.880
for all of our skin, just the surface, seeing like what is the surface of my coffee and then


00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:33.040
that same thermometer kind of getting like the bed the pile and the temperature of the bed pile


00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:42.560
and then also the surface and then again my ambient temperature. I want to see kind of that difference.


00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:48.440
This is a picture of a totally different client in Atsawaro


00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.640
who, they built this warehouse


00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.640
and you see all of these, the wood was going to be their pallets


00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.640
and it was so hot it melted, those are melted fans


00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:02.640
because they put all of the corrugated metal


00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.240
and this is where they were storing their coffee


00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.640
it was so hot it melted their fans


00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.640
but again, like so often we don't think about


00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.640
And so, we're like, "Oh, the coffee's dry, it's in there, it's fine."


00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.640
We don't think about the pressure that it's under.


00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.640
So, they don't do this anymore.


00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:20.640
[laughter]


00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.640
>> Also done under?


00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:22.640
>> No.


00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:23.640
>> Okay.


00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.640
[laughter]


00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.640
>> Yeah, that's pretty wild.


00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.640
>> And then you are, "Mm, one nice cookie day's pay-free."


00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.640
>> Yeah.


00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:32.640
[laughter]


00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.640
>> Exactly.


00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.640
And so, this is my point where they thought, "Oh, our coffee is plain, boring.


00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.640
We need to fix the fermentation."


00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:43.640
And this is why I don't do that much virtual consulting anymore,


00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.640
because they don't know that this is a problem.


00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:47.640
I need to go there and I need to look at your facility,


00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:51.640
and then this is a much easier thing to fix than your fermentation.


00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.640
My fermentation went fine.


00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:57.640
And they thought, "Oh, our coffee's just plain and boring. We need to spice it up."


00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.640
Or you just don't--


00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.640
That's what's in it.


00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.640
Yeah.


00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.640
Or just don't try it here.


00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:07.640
Yeah. Okay. So that's what we got with the last group.


00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:14.640
So the rest of this, mechanical drying and then water activity and DNA cycles, we'll


00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.640
talk about tomorrow.


00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:20.640
No, no, no, no, it's like...


00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:28.640
The room where we put the genetor, after a while you notice, because it's so much water and moisture,


00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:35.640
I'm sure those colours weren't what I painted, I mean you realise the room is completely mouldy.


00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.640
Yeah, we have that problem here.


00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.640
You have to run and power wash the ceiling, the walls, the tanks, everything.


00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.640
And it's something I have to do regularly.


00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:50.640
Well, something you might be able to do is because the pulping stuff is such a high humidity,


00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:56.640
water, yeah, such a water consuming stuff, is try to separate those out.


00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.640
Because you pulp where you ferment.


00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:02.640
So if you could pulp maybe outside where there's way more ventilation.


00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:07.640
Have some place that's more ventilated where you have all the water activities


00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:10.640
and then ferment in your closed room where you have the lower, so.


00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.640
For sure.


00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:12.640
Yeah.


00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.640
Because you're going to get a gas pump.


00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.640
So that's the outside. Both of them.


00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.640
Perfect.


00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:24.640
But more, you'd be surprised how it creeps up on you.


00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.640
Oh, no I wouldn't. I would not be surprised.


00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.640
Here, I mean, even just, you know, in the mill that we were working with here,


00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.640
it was just constant on the roof.


00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:40.640
And the other thing was building something that is like visually or aesthetically interesting,


00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:45.360
seeing like high ceiling, whatever, it's so difficult to clean because it was so hard to get out there.


00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:51.040
So a lot of times we don't have that design, that practicality in mind when we're designing.


00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.480
I'm trying to clean myself. I use bleach with ammonia.


00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:58.000
And then you wonder why you don't use pepper.


00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.240
You wonder why your lungs hurt.


00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.060
Yeah.


00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:08.800
Yeah, about this, we have another 10 pages of presentation


00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.540
and I did the choice.


00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:20.960
So,


00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:30.960
