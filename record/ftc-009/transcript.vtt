WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
But you can see what we're doing.


00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:13.500
So we're doing things a little bit before.


00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.080
This is just to get the process started.


00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.080
It's not going to make sense until we all sit down and talk about it.


00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.740
So don't worry.


00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.820
(laughs)


00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:42.380
So the yeast that we're using is called Sema.


00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.580
This is a Lau Cafe yeast.


00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.540
Lau Cafe is the brand


00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.140
and Sema is just the commercial name.


00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.580
It's just the, it's not like a strain.


00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.700
It's the, yeah, the commercial name


00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.340
that the company has given it.


00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.020
I like this yeast because it is the most,


00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.660
like it plays very well with a lot of varieties.


00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.500
I put this on Castillo, I put this on Tabby,


00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.860
I put this on Sous-Valbre-Mais,


00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.780
I put this on random hybrids.


00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.340
This is, it just is not the best option for all of them,


00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.620
but it is the most good across the board.


00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.620
the most universal. (speaking in foreign language)


00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.620
It's not the best, but I've tried it with many varieties, many different types of coffee


00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.620
and in almost all cases it works very well.


00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.620
So it's like the most universal, the easiest to use, the one I think of the most.


00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.620
So this yeast was developed for coffee.


00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.620
They started with a base of wine, like the yeast that exists for wine,


00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.540
(speaking in foreign language)


00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.740
It's like the way to choose a variety of coffee to say,


00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.440
"Okay, this one needs those ingredients,


00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.240
it behaves very well with this temperature."


00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.240
So, they are being selected.


00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.340
But it's not like something that is genetically modified.


00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.540
It's just selected from nature.


00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.840
From what already exists, they are selecting the characteristics of this strain


00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.840
that works well with coffee.


00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.140
And it depends on the location, for example?


00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.140
Yes, for example, can you use this in other regions of Colombia?


00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:35.140
Totally, no, I have used it in Africa, Guatemala, in all 13 different countries with 30 different varieties.


00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.140
This works very well for me. It is universal.


00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.140
And in the commercialized, where is it?


00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.140
Here in Colombia, right now they only have like 3 or 4 positions.


00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.140
one in Guatemala, one in El Salvador, one here in Colombia where they have yeast in existence.


00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:01.140
In other countries they are making alliances with baristas, with other people in the coffee world


00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.140
who can keep a small stock in their countries or who can communicate with the people.


00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.140
Because that is made in Denmark, but there is a lot of existence in the United States.


00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.140
So there are two bigger places where they have all the yeast.


00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.140
So it's very easy to get in the United States and in those three Latin American countries.


00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.140
And in the rest of the world it's going slowly.


00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.140
The brand is Alcafe.


00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.140
Alcafe.


00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.140
Just as a reference, how much can it cost?


00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:38.140
This, only the yeast, is 500 grams and it's like 45 dollars.


00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.140
The yeast.


00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.200
The fleta can be like three times the cost


00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.200
because it depends on all the requirements


00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.700
and you need that certificate


00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.200
so each country is very different


00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.200
so it's very difficult to say how much it costs in India


00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.000
and how much it costs


00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.900
but the mere yeast should be $45


00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.300
And how much is it used to ferment?


00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.000
It is used to ferment, the dose is


00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.200
1 kilo of sculpted coffee, 1 gram of yeast


00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.000
1 kilo per gram


00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:38.920
[Spanish]


00:04:38.920 --> 00:05:06.920
[Spanish]


00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.920
So what we're talking about is...


00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.920
They also have Intenso.


00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.920
There are four.


00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.920
Four commercially available.


00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.920
What do you think about Intenso?


00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.920
I like it too. It's just one of the newer ones.


00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.920
So I've been using this one for like seven years.


00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.920
Intenso is like four years old.


00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.920
So I just haven't used it as long.


00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.920
But I like it a lot too.


00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.920
It's really interchangeable. This is just what I had in my closet.


00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.920
So I like this one.


00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.920
Cash.


00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.920
So we're chatting that this


00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:43.240
yeast is originally from the wine world. So it was selected from an existing bank of Saccharomyces


00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.480
yeast. So it wasn't like developed, it wasn't genetically modified, it's just in the way that


00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.320
you do plant breeding and you say I like how tall this one is, I like how fruitful this one is,


00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.880
I like the flavor of this one, I'm going to cross breed and then I'm going to get a new plant that


00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.040
I like the characteristics of. That's how they do yeast breeding too. They say this yeast has


00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.920
has really good temperature tolerance.


00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.240
This yeast has really good, like,


00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.520
low nutrient requirements.


00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.360
It's a very easy yeast.


00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.320
Let's breed those together


00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.440
and then we'll get something different.


00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.980
So it's not genetically modified,


00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.920
it's just bred to be the conditions of coffee


00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.820
that have really different temperatures,


00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.520
that have very intense, like, a lot of pressure,


00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.640
a lot of competition from other yeast.


00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.580
We know that the conditions in Beneficios are challenging


00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.680
in terms of not having a lot of cleanliness


00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.920
or like hygiene practices.


00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.120
So this yeast is really tough to withstand a lot.


00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.840
So there could be another yeast that's like more beautiful


00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.720
and more delicate and gives you like jasmine florals.


00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.320
But as soon as you put it in a mill environment,


00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.360
it's just gonna struggle


00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.200
and potentially just not really do anything.


00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.720
So the other important question that people wanna know


00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.000
is the price of this yeast.


00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.400
So this 500 gram brick is about $45.


00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.400
And that's pretty expensive in the world of coffee.


00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.080
We talked about prices.


00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.040
Fertilizer, like the pressures that producers have,


00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.840
$45 is a lot.


00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.560
The goal originally of the company was to make yeast


00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.460
be about, add four to five cents a pound


00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.240
to the cost of production.


00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.680
So about the cost of a grain pro.


00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.920
Like it should be something fairly manageable.


00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.920
But because it's still early and there's so few places


00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:34.040
have it, the cost of actually getting this shipped to you with freight, with all of the


00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:39.240
certificates, you need to have a phytosanitary certificate and all of the barriers, it ends up


00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:45.960
being like 15 to 20 cents a pound extra, which is really expensive for a lot of producers to afford.


00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.480
So that's a bit of the barrier, like it's so expensive, nobody's using it, but until more


00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.440
people start using it, the cost can't go down. So we're like in this like five-year stalemate.


00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:06.080
So I still think it's a really good method, but it's just really important to point out that it's not that accessible yet.


00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.080
Unless you have connections in the US, you should bring some in your suitcase.


00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:20.080
Colombia, actually Colombia has stock. In Colombia, Guatemala has stock, and El Salvador has like a warehouse with this yeast already there.


00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:26.240
to paper shipping. It's still pretty expensive, but the company's working on finding partners


00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.520
in producing countries that can keep a small stock. And Joey's question was, "How long


00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:36.840
does it last?" So if you keep it like this, vacuum sealed, cool, better in the fridge


00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.840
if it's unopened, you can keep it for three years. Three to four years. So you can have


00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.840
it over multiple seasons.


00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:51.480
freezer. I don't think that's necessary. Usually a lot of places, like freezer


00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:57.520
space is at a premium, so it's in most Latin countries it's it's a big ask to


00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.440
have this much in a freezer. If you can't, it's not gonna hurt it, it's just not a


00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.720
requirement. So I just like to say keep it room temperature but cool, but better


00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:14.080
if you can use it, if you can use it sooner. And this yeast is produced in cool places,


00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:21.480
so this is manufactured in Denmark. And it's another question, like, why isn't it manufactured


00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:27.960
in Latin countries? Like, why don't they have a plant here to make it? My understanding


00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:36.120
is that the process to make this yeast is so energy intensive. It releases so much heat


00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.960
that the cooling cost would be cost prohibitive here.


00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.060
And so in places like Denmark, or they also do it.


00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.140
I don't remember where else right now.


00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.400
Denmark is the most the biggest plant.


00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.680
They use a natural cooling properties of the region


00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.880
to to manage these really hot reactions.


00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.860
What else was I going to say?


00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.120
So right now, we're going to rehydrate the yeast.


00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.120
And again, we're working a little bit backwards.


00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.800
We're going to do the thing because the coffee's ready,


00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.880
and then we're going to talk about why are we doing this more slowly.


00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.880
So no worries.


00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.240
So the most important thing is how much yeast do we use?


00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.040
The dosage I mentioned is one gram per one kilogram.


00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.240
So how many kilos of pulped coffee do we have?


00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.360
We can weigh it.


00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.120
We can weigh the tank.


00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.320
But at this point, we can do a calculation as well.


00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.680
I know how much cherry came in because we weighed the cherry.


00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.360
[INAUDIBLE]


00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:33.860
Yes.


00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.860
So who's going to help me with the calculator?


00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:43.860
So, the cherry that came in, 500 kilos, right?


00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.860
Yes.


00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:49.860
500 kilos of cherry, but we took 45 kilos of green.


00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.860
45 kilos.


00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.860
45 kilos of green that we selected yesterday.


00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.860
And we took 10 kilos of the ripe one.


00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.860
So we took out...


00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.860
45 kilos.


00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.860
Huh?


00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.860
440 kilos.


00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.860
445.


00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.860
So the way that I would do this normally is to weigh my pulped coffee.


00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.860
But it's a little bit complicated right now just because of the scale and the lifting the tank.


00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.860
So I can do it mathematically.


00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.860
So I know how much cherry came in. 500 kilos.


00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.860
I'm going to take away my green, which was 45.


00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.860
I'm going to take away the overripe, which was 10.


00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.860
So now I have 445.


00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.860
445.


00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.860
So I'm just going to divide that in half.


00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:36.100
say half of my weight was lost with my skins.


00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.500
will we weigh one nerdfill off?


00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:51.980
1/2 pan


00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:57.300
1/2 pan for jelly lined ale?


00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:16.300
[Spanish]


00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:21.800
So it's not the most exact, the best way. If you want to, like when I'm with a new client, we weigh it.


00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.280
We weigh our cherry, and then we pulp our coffee,


00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.640
and then we weigh our pulp coffee


00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.200
to see if it's 55%, if it's 60%.


00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.100
You know, it'll also depend on the variety and our dense.


00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.680
But for practical purposes,


00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.040
it's just easy to cut it in half for right now.


00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.600
So 222 kilos.


00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.640
But we're making a citric lot and a lactic lot.


00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.440
So I already asked Sebas to separate that.


00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.600
So the citric is 14 kilos.


00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.520
(speaking in foreign language)


00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.440
(speaking in foreign language)


00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:18.260
So they took our pulped coffee.


00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.100
You don't have to memorize this,


00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.980
This is sort of like, we took our pulped coffee,


00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.700
and I know I'm taking some for the citric,


00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.780
and I know I'm taking some for the lactic.


00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.100
And those were easy to weigh,


00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.460
so Sebastian already weighed those.


00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.460
So what I have left, kilos available for my yeast,


00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.260
is 196 kilos.


00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:38.260
196 kilos pulped, 196 grams of yeast.


00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.100
So I'm gonna weigh that out right now.


00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:46.020
- And then what, how, you said three years closed and sealed.


00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.820
How long after this?


00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:48.660
- Really good question.


00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:57.300
after it's open it would depend on my my condition so here very humid and with


00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:03.700
this yeast is is dried so in these humid conditions if it starts to rehydrate on


00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:10.500
its own it starts to not be available for me to use so in these conditions I


00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:16.220
like to use the packet like within the week with more coffee coming in maybe it


00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:21.740
could last like two weeks, but it's much shorter because we have all this moisture in the air.


00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:25.740
What about if it were like separated out with a smaller vac sealed?


00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.740
It could be open and vac sealed immediately and that'd be okay enough?


00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.740
That's a better option.


00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.740
And then it would last longer?


00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.740
It would last longer.


00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:41.740
So, it's three years in the empty, but now that it's open and exposed to all the humidity


00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:47.740
that we have in these producing countries, I prefer to use the bag in about two weeks.


00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:52.740
And now that it's open, you can't store it at the same time.


00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.740
So, what I want is 196.


00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.980
(sniffing)


00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:24.580
(speaking in foreign language)


00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.080
You wanna smell it?


00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:53.080
[ Background noise ]


00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:59.580
So this recipe of kilo to pulp coffee,


00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.580
the kilo of parchment to yeast,


00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.580
and then how much water we use is in your packet,


00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.580
so you don't have to memorize any of this.


00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.580
And it's a very standard recipe,


00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.580
and it's on the back of the bag.


00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.580
So you don't have to worry about memorizing any of this.


00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.580
But what I want now is 10 times the weight.


00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.580
So this is almost, like, it's going to be,


00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:30.500
say 200 grams so I want two liters of water to rehydrate and I want


00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:46.140
so the formula for the yeast recipe is 10 times the weight in water


00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:52.140
Entonces vamos a decir 200 gramos, entonces quiero 2 litros de agua caliente.


00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.140
Esa receta está en el paquete y también está en la bolsa.


00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:02.140
Entonces no es algo para memorizar, es algo muy conocido.


00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:07.140
Ahora, yo quiero el agua de la levadura a 37 grados.


00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.140
Entonces tomo agua fría.


00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:15.140
Cold water, I want 37 degrees to rehydrate my yeast.


00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.860
this is at 21


00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:23.900
cold water and then


00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:29.860
hot water. So this is at 63.


00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.140
So I'm just gonna mix hot and cold.


00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:38.860
Voy a mezclar para llegar a los dos litros con agua de 37.


00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.660
It's just a guess and check.


00:17:45.660 --> 00:18:03.660
41, I want 37, more cold water.


00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:14.780
37 and I want 2 liters.


00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:20.180
No los cumpli. So I didn't quite get to 2 liters. It's up there so I'm just gonna


00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.860
add a little bit more cold.


00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.860
37.5, it's very close.


00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.060
The goal is 37.


00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.460
The goal is 37.


00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.060
So what I prefer to prepare the yeast is


00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.860
first mix to get to 37 and if I go over,


00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:50.860
throw a little.


00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.660
Many times I see people who waste time


00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.460
trying to do both at the same time,


00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.860
just get to two and it's not necessary.


00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.660
So I already have my two liters


00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.860
and I'm going to add, that point is very important,


00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.460
yeast to water, not water to yeast.


00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:10.460
It's like in the kitchen. The powder to the water.


00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:15.580
So this is an important part too, is now that I have my two liters of water at 37,


00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.740
I add yeast to water, not the water to the yeast. So just like in baking, you


00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.820
want to add your dry ingredients to your wet.


00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:29.740
And I use the same thermometer to mix.


00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:37.500
I want. You don't have to go that slow but we definitely don't want to agitate it too much.


00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.260
(birds chirping)


00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:50.780
(speaking in foreign language)


00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:56.780
I also benefited from the fact that they had some problems with the yeast.


00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:02.780
They already had a harvest experimenting with the yeast and they didn't get the results they expected.


00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:15.780
And when I saw how they were preparing it, they were using a mixer, a drill, to mix the yeast very quickly.


00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.780
A mixer.


00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:25.780
and the yeast is alive, so we shouldn't mistreat it.


00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:30.780
What I want is that everything touches water.


00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.780
Here it's a little dry on top.


00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.780
Everything is in water.


00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:42.780
Very little is left in my thermometer.


00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.780
And I need a stopwatch for 20 minutes.


00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:59.760
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.340
So that's what you don't want to do.


00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.200
You don't want to go by time.


00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.720
You don't want to say, I started it at 9.45, so I came at 10.05.


00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.040
What you want to do is set a timer, because you will forget.


00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:13.880
You'll get busy.


00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.160
You'll do something else.


00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.900
So if you do it by time or you do like a counting up,


00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.580
like how much time has passed.


00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.500
So like this is counting up.


00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.580
I don't want to count up because what we're doing is


00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.940
the yeast is asleep.


00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.500
We're rehydrating it, we're waking it up.


00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.280
So you've woken it up, you've woken up the beast.


00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.660
And if you don't give it food, then it starts to die.


00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.020
So if you wait 30 minutes,


00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.300
then that time the beast is starting to die.


00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.220
(speaking in foreign language)


00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.140
(speaking in foreign language)


00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:54.060
(speaking in foreign language)


00:21:54.060 --> 00:22:01.060
So it's to maintain the temperature and to avoid insects or other things that can get into the jar.


00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:05.060
And we're going to leave it still for 20 minutes.


00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:13.060
So what Marco and Katia said was, "Okay, we see the time, so at 3.15 we have to check the temperature."


00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:21.060
And they said, "No, that's not the right way because we get busy, something else happens and we forget and it's been half an hour."


00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.980
(speaking in foreign language)


00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.900
(speaking in foreign language)


00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:33.900
and if we don't add food to it in 20 minutes, it starts to die.


00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.900
And we don't do anything.


00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.900
So that's another problem that I see very common in benefits,


00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.900
is that they prepare the yeast to advance the work,


00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.900
they prepare it, they wake it up, and they forget it and go to something else,


00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:49.900
and it died, and then they add dead yeast to fermentation, and nothing happens.


00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.900
And you say, "No, that yeast is not useful."


00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.900
No, because they woke it up and didn't give it food.


00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.900
So that's something to keep in mind.


00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.900
So I don't want to...


00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:04.900
It's better to have an alarm set up to say,


00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.900
"20 minutes, we have to pay attention to her."


00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:13.900
Another mistake I see very common is that people overmix,


00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.900
like they mix it too hard, and they're checking her.


00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.900
It's like, to respect the yeast, we wake her up in warm water,


00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.900
and we're going to leave her alone.


00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.900
We're not going to be moving it from one side to the other.


00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.900
It's like giving it time to wake up.


00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.900
It's not convenient to shake with a spoon.


00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.900
Because the shaking was very light.


00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.900
Very light, and if you use a spoon,


00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.900
the spoon has a larger surface area,


00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.900
so more yeast stays stuck to the spoon.


00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.900
Or worse, in large quantities, when we use a bucket,


00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.900
they use a wooden spoon for the juice.


00:23:51.900 --> 00:24:13.900
[Spanish]


00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.900
So what we're talking about is the lid is important.


00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:23.820
a little bit of a temperature retention just to be able to kind of keep it at that warm state.


00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:28.540
We don't have a problem today because it's hot here but in other like higher elevation places


00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:33.980
it gets very cold and so the yeast can drop temperature very quickly. We also want a lid


00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:40.060
to prevent any insects coming in and contaminating our yeast. And the other part that's important


00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:46.700
that a lot of people get wrong is they we have 20 minutes where we just leave her alone and let her


00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:52.860
wake up slowly. If we do it by time and say, "Okay, it's 9.45, so at 10.05 I'll be back."


00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:57.740
That's 20 minutes. Then we could forget. We just get busy or something else happens and then we


00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:03.660
just... the time, the 20 minutes passes. And what's happening is that we've... the yeast is asleep,


00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:11.420
we've asked it to wake up, then we don't give her food and then she starts to die. And so a lot of


00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.820
times people are putting dead yeast or half-active yeast into their fermentation because they weren't


00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.900
paying attention to the time because in a lot of places you want to do things efficiently and


00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.820
quickly so you prepare the yeast in the beginning of the day and then you pulp like four hours later


00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:29.420
and your yeast is completely dead. So this is not a step that can be done in advance. It's really


00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:34.380
something that you do when your coffee's pulped and that's why if we had started this this morning


00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:40.620
it took us four hours. They started at 6 30, it's almost 10, he's still pulping. So you really can't


00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:45.780
start that early. You have to time it to when my coffee is ready to be added.


00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:50.700
Because what we're gonna do is we're gonna add coffee to this, give her some food.


00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:57.660
So if the weather is quite cold, I mean the water, how high can you put it?


00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:06.660
Because I mean you start from 37, but if right here, like 10 or something else, can you be a little bit higher?


00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:13.220
In that case, I would put the container in a water bath so that it maintains the temperature.


00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:20.140
Because, again, we're thinking about how rude it would be if you're asleep and they just drop you in cold water.


00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.180
And you wake up and you're like, "I don't want to work."


00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.900
So we're trying to be very gentle to the yeast.


00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:31.660
We're trying to wake them up in a warm bath, give her time, not a lot of agitation.


00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.160
So I mentioned you saw me just get everything wet


00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.240
and with a little bit of agitation.


00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.340
The story I mentioned in Spanish was I went to a place


00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:40.980
where they had been using the yeast for a while,


00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.180
but they weren't getting the results that they wanted.


00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.280
And when I got there, 'cause they were doing big batches.


00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.360
So they, instead of this container,


00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.020
they had like five gallon buckets


00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.180
that they were using a bunch at a time.


00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.420
And to make it easier for them,


00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.500
they were using a drill to like mix,


00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.640
like a really fast mixer with a drill


00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.340
to like get all the yeast wet.


00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:04.580
And so again, I think that was really affecting


00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.420
the activity of their yeast


00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:10.060
because they're very rough with the yeast.


00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.100
- And why we waiting, how we know that it's still


00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.380
breaking up or it's just splitting?


00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.660
Because sometimes we see some activity, some bubbling.


00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.780
- Yeah, so the way that you know that


00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:25.140
is kind of the reputation of the brand.


00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.820
So you kind of have to trust


00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:30.460
because not all yeast will bubble.


00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.540
It really depends on the strain.


00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.440
Not, they don't all like bubble and are really active.


00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.860
A lot of them are just 'cause it's easier to see.


00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.920
So just because there's not a lot of activity


00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.160
doesn't mean it's dead.


00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.540
But then you think about, okay, how old is it?


00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.600
Oh, I've had this sitting here for five years.


00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.600
Or this is like a not, you know, it's a off-brand.


00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.740
It's like some other random yeast.


00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.300
It could be because of that.


00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.540
So buying from a company that has a good reputation,


00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.520
that's been doing it for a long time,


00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.700
knowing that your expiration date is not past,


00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.460
and knowing that you didn't drop the temperature,


00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:11.060
like you said, if we were in a really cold mountaintop,


00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.180
and this was warm, but the environment was really cold


00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.700
and it dropped really fast,


00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.740
that would really affect the activity.


00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.820
So we wanna be gentle.


00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.700
So it's just kind of like looking at all those factors


00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.140
to say, is it just the yeast that doesn't bubble,


00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:27.340
or is my yeast expire old, a bad source?


00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:35.340
So if everything was fine, even though we had to stay like this, we have to trust it?


00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.340
Kind of have to trust it, yes.


00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:46.340
And we'll see more of the visual clues a little bit later once we add it, and then tomorrow once it's had a chance to get going, you'll see more of those clues.


00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:53.340
But a little bit is just kind of that experience to know, is it dead, or is it just shy?


00:28:53.340 --> 00:29:02.100
[INAUDIBLE]


00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.780
Some batches are more active than others?


00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.280
Yes.


00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.260
So that's the question.


00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:08.980
But we afraid that some batch kind of--


00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:09.940
like nothing happen?


00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:10.440
Mm-hmm.


00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.580
Is it OK to not--


00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.300
So it is a natural product.


00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.860
So any time it's a natural product,


00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.020
there's going to be variation.


00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.180
So what I would do is if you know you're using SEMA,


00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.460
you have the lot number.


00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.540
So you can see, is this lot number,


00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.780
is it all from the same lot that's behaving one way?


00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.900
And you tell them, you write them an email and you say,


00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.720
"Hey, this is what I noticed on this batch


00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.900
"with this lot number in this batch with this lot number."


00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.560
And then they can say, "Oh, actually,


00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.940
"we used a new stabilizer and it's totally fine.


00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.740
"There's a little less activity in that batch."


00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:42.340
Or, "Oh, this is really bad, let's get you a new lot."


00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.180
So you have to tell them.


00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.260
And that's also the benefit of going with a company


00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.740
that has a long history,


00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.380
is that you can have that customer service.


00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.820
You can say--


00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.420
- But the variation could also be


00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.420
because of temperature or agitation.


00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.900
- So that's the information that you would want to tell them


00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.900
when they can say, "Well, did you use a drill to mix it?"


00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.020
And you say, "No, Lucia said be very gentle.


00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.980
"I used a spoon.


00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:08.980
"This is my temperature."


00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.500
So that you can tell them to,


00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.600
"I did my part.


00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:16.820
"Maybe it was the batch.


00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.260
"Maybe something went wrong."


00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:36.260
How do I know how much water I need to use? 10 times the weight. So that's in your packet, and it's also in here. 500 grams, 5 liters. Going into...


00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.260
to the amount of water.


00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.260
And that's the weight.


00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.260
And the type of water


00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.260
does it influence?


00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.260
It influences a lot.


00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.260
So for this step,


00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.260
the type of water should be potable.


00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.260
If I don't drink it, I won't give it to the yeast.


00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.260
I won't drink


00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.260
river water to


00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.260
rehydrate the yeast.


00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.260
Does chlorine or something else affect the yeast?


00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.260
It affects a lot because chlorine is


00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.260
antimicrobial, so


00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:08.180
(speaking in foreign language)


00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:25.860
- You can boil it and let it rest


00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.580
and then like you get the rest of the water.


00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.500
(speaking in foreign language)


00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.500
and let it cool down


00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.500
and use it to eliminate its compotency


00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.500
so the fermentation water


00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.500
doesn't have to be drinkable


00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.500
we are using


00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.500
hose water, any


00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.500
but for this step


00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:53.500
So she's alive, she's happy.


00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.500
Was it bumped or did that just happen?


00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.500
No.


00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.500
It was like kind of a layer of bubble underneath the bottle.


00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:04.500
And then it just like, flipped over.


00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.500
So you were saying it's okay if that water is chlorinated?


00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:13.500
Not necessarily chlorinated, I'm saying I'm very strict about this water being potable water.


00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:17.760
water. If you wouldn't drink it, don't give it to the yeast. I wouldn't go drink a


00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.920
cup of water from the river, so I'm not gonna use that water for beer. Just to activate it.


00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:27.880
Just to activate it. Just to activate it because whatever's in the tank... I mean,


00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.320
so people say is there like a perfect water and I'm like, well what are you


00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:36.280
gonna do to like rechange the structure of your mill to get perfect water? So


00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:41.460
it's like I don't talk about things that are so outside of like the scope of what


00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.340
a typical producer can do.


00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.660
So would it be better to have all potable water?


00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.380
Absolutely.


00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:47.340
Who's going to do that?


00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.180
Like, it's not worth it for me to mention that.


00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.700
So I just say, at least for this,


00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.420
can you get two liters of drinkable water


00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.780
to process this much coffee?


00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.260
So tap water should be OK?


00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:04.420
Yeah, if you would drink it, that's my biggest--


00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:08.860
So it doesn't have to be the aisle water, high TBS mineral


00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:10.740
water, anything?


00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:11.740
Just if you would drink it.


00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:12.740
Okay.


00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:13.740
Yeah.


00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:14.740
Chlorine, sorry, chlorine wouldn't affect you.


00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:15.740
Chlorine does affect it because chlorine is something that we want to, the bacteria, it's


00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.740
a sanitizing agent.


00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:17.740
So this is a microbe.


00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.740
So you don't want to sit here like that.


00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:19.740
Yeah.


00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:20.740
So unchlorinated potable water.


00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:21.740
Yeah.


00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:22.740
And you can...


00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:23.740
What about distilled water?


00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.740
Do you have this option?


00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.740
Yeah.


00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:26.740
Okay.


00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:27.740
So you can drink it.


00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.740
Yeah.


00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.740
Okay.


00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:30.740
So you can drink it.


00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:31.740
Yeah.


00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:32.740
Okay.


00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:33.740
So you can drink it.


00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:34.740
Yeah.


00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.740
Okay.


00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:36.740
So you can drink it.


00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:37.740
Yeah.


00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.740
Okay.


00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:39.740
Okay.


00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:48.220
I haven't tried it with distilled water. I would imagine you want some kind of mineral


00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:55.780
composition. I don't know. I've never tried it with distilled water. I find distilled


00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:01.460
water really difficult to get here in Latin countries.


00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:11.460
What's your opinion about somebody using yeast in a liquid?


00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.460
What do you mean, prepare yeast?


00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:17.460
I mean, not the dry yeast, but the fresh yeast.


00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:21.460
Oh, I think that's great.


00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:30.460
A lot of beer yeasts are prepared that way, that are already rehydrated and you just pitch a certain amount of the bottle.


00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.280
that's great. This is already expensive enough and this is completely dry so


00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:39.480
when you have those other yeast you're shipping water so it's way more expensive


00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:43.440
but if you have that like if you live near a brewery and they can just give


00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.720
you some that's great but I just generally recommend this is the it's


00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:52.060
already expensive and it's the cheapest option. While we're waiting for this


00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:58.520
we've got like seven more minutes right we're going to... Cecil do you have your pH meter?


00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:06.560
So one of the things we were talking about over there is how many producers invest in


00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:13.040
tanks, beautiful fermentation bioreactors, and they don't even have a pH meter.


00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:18.200
So it's sort of like, you know, where you're putting your source, your attention.


00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:22.200
We are talking about producers that invest a lot in their tanks,


00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:26.200
they have a bioreactor of stainless steel and they don't have a pH meter.


00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:32.200
So they are focusing on the wrong things, because a pH meter gives you a lot of information


00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:41.200
and a tank is not the only way to get, or it is not the best way to get a successful fermentation.


00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:47.200
But the other problem, many have a bioreactor tank and they don't have a pH meter


00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:52.600
and those that do have a pH meter don't have liquids to calibrate.


00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.600
I hardly see that. If they have a pH meter, they don't have liquids. Right?


00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:57.600
Yes.


00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:05.480
So the biggest, if you guys want chairs, we're going to be here a while.


00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:11.280
The biggest disappointment is seeing producers that spend all this money on a bioreactor


00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.640
and these beautiful tanks and don't even have a pH meter.


00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.960
It's like 20 bucks, 30 bucks.


00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:19.040
And if they do have a pH meter, hardly anybody has buffers.


00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.040
No one's calibrating their pH meters.


00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:26.040
They don't realize how quickly they come out of calibration.


00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.920
So this is what you need to get.


00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.420
You have some, okay.


00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:37.280
So your question was, so he has this pH meter and he asked me, does this work?


00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.520
And that's what your liquids will tell you.


00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.640
So have you not tried it?


00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:49.720
Two things I will mention right off the bat is this probe is a glass bulb and it's very


00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.720
delicate.


00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:57.720
One of the things I will notice is that this glass bowl is a little bit dirty. It has some residue on it.


00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:58.720
You guys want to see?


00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.720
It's a little bit dirty, the bulb.


00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.720
And it's dry.


00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:08.720
It's like another point is to keep the bulb moist.


00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:12.720
So, how do you clean it?


00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:22.720
Hey, can you bring my, um, can you just bring the tubes for the little satchels, the targets?


00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:50.720
[Spanish]


00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.720
So I want to show you the one that I have.


00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.720
There's liquid in here.


00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.220
And you can see my bulb.


00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:55.720
Oh, it's clean.


00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.720
It's very clean.


00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.220
[LAUGHTER]


00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.220
So it's a clean bulb, and you keep it moist.


00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.220
[DOG BARKING]


00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.220
So what you're going to want to do--


00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.220
can you see it?


00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.720
[DOG BARKING]


00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.720

[DOG BARKING]


00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:15.220
So let's see.


00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.720
And you said you keep it moist.


00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.720
Is this like--


00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.220
There's some storage solution, or you can use buffers.


00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:27.500
like the buffer that's closest to it. I just put a couple drops in the cap.


00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:43.860
El vidrio del bombillo. You can see the glass. One is very clear and one is


00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.360
decorated.


00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:59.360
So I'm going to put all of these in here.


00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.860
(dog barking)


00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:12.740
I'm gonna turn them all on and let's see what they say.


00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:18.640
We're gonna give them a minute.


00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.860
So this one it says it has a watch,


00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:23.060
so it's thinking, it's waiting.


00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:32.700
So this is a cleaning solution.


00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.500
So you can get either little packets like this that are easy,


00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.000
and you open it and you stick it in.


00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.900
Or you can get a full bottle of cleaning solution.


00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.100
It's not expensive.


00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:46.300
And yeah, Hanna Instruments is a really good company.


00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.500
Do you want to take a picture?


00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.800
Oh, you already got a picture.


00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:54.860
Is this for example purposes, or do you


00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:59.460
I recommend using more than one to take off the samples across.


00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:05.060
I recommend having more than one because pH meters are pretty cheap, they're really useful,


00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.180
and they don't last as long as people think.


00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:13.220
I mean, these pH meters, they really should be like a year, two years, depending on your


00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.780
use, and I've seen people that keep them for five forever.


00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.340
They're like, "I have one forever," and they're not that robust.


00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:20.340
They're not that expensive.


00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.100
20 bucks, you know, get new ones.


00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.500
So the other thing is, let's see these.


00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.640
So this is buffer four.


00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.780
All of these should say four.


00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.300
This one says 3.9, I accept.


00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:38.780
Look at this, this one says 5.9.


00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.280
Very un-gallop-rated.


00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.940
This one says 13.


00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.040
This one is crazy.


00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:48.100
And my three is still thinking.


00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.180
And so-so, let's see.


00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.220
What do we have here?


00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:54.620
How recently were these used to be that off?


00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:55.620
Last September.


00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:59.660
So I haven't used these since the last FGC.


00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:05.660
So now our yeast, you can see some.


00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:14.660
You can see like these geysers.


00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:18.580
(speaking in foreign language)


00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:30.400
- So the temperature is still really important.


00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.200
So I wanna see how much has it dropped or has it gone up.


00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.000
So one degree, 37 to 36.


00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.920
(speaking in foreign language)


00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:44.840
(speaking in foreign language)


00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.760
(speaking in foreign language)


00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.760
they are colder


00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.760
That's what I knew


00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.760
The coffee is at 22°C


00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.760
So, from 36°C to 22°C


00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.760
is a very strong thermal shock


00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.760
for the yeast


00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.760
We wake it up like this, calm


00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.760
soft, hot water


00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.760
and if we leave it cold


00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.760
it can be damaged


00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.760
So, what we do is


00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.760
we lower the temperature


00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.760
soft, we add a little bit of


00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.760
cold coffee to lower the temperature


00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.480
(speaking in foreign language)


00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.740
Now it's really going.


00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:20.580
Look at her go.


00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:21.420
- Go.


00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:23.660
(laughing)


00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:27.880
- How are you?


00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.520
- So, Mac, do you see this?


00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:32.120
There's no question that she's wearing a badge.


00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.960
- Oh yeah, like this, no question.


00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:34.800
(laughing)


00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.040
Sometimes it's just really low activity,


00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.200
so we just kind of worry.


00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.040
- Yes, and that's when you take a note of the badge,


00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.360
and we'll take other--


00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:48.360
because we just, I mean, should we wait longer?


00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.360
What we should do with that?


00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.360
I mean, just think.


00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.360
I'm in everyone's picture.


00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.360
By the time that happened, we just acting.


00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.360
Should we wait a little bit longer?


00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.360
Sometimes I do.


00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.360
If she's a little bit slow, I do give her more time.


00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.360
But she's very, very active, so she's like, "Feed me!"


00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.360
So now I'm just going to add,


00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.360
this is going to splash everywhere.


00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:12.360
So I'm adding cold coffee.


00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.860
(dog barking)


00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:16.640
How much coffee?


00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.480
I don't know.


00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.300
Guess and check.


00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.800
(dog barking)


00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:27.680
So I wanna drop my temperature slowly.


00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:34.240
33, 34.


00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.320
That was only two degrees.


00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.860
So I wanna drop a little bit more


00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.220
'cause I wanna be within 10 degrees of my coffee.


00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:43.740
I want it to be 32 below.


00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:47.260
10 is an important number.


00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:51.260
10 times the weight, 10 degrees, 10...


00:43:51.260 --> 00:44:01.540
So you want it to be in between the temperature between the yeast solution and the coffee?


00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:02.060
Yes.


00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:11.860
So now I'm within 10, 32 and 22.


00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:12.700
Coffee.


00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:16.220
I'm gonna put a little bit more just to get closer.


00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.720
(dog barking)


00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.720
[speaking Spanish]


00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:28.720
I lowered it to 36, I lowered it to 32, the coffee is at 22. We are already at 10 degrees.


00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:34.720
But I had more coffee, so if I can lower it a little more.


00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.720
They are always 10 degrees of difference.


00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:44.720
Or less. The less the better. But it was more than 10, so I have to lower it, at least to that window, that range of 10.


00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.720
Of the coffee?


00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.640
(speaking in foreign language)


00:44:49.640 --> 00:45:05.940
15 more minutes, 10 minutes, let's do 10.


00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:09.520
(speaking in foreign language)


00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.860
10, 10 minutes.


00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.580
So it's not just about dropping the temperature


00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:16.880
and adding the coffee, it's dropping the temperature,


00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.380
letting the yeast have time to adapt to the new temperature,


00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.860
and then we'll add the coffee.


00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:23.260
So let me wash my hands.


00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:26.260
(people chattering)


00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:45.280
[ Background noise ]


00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:49.220
>> Okay, so where's my seven?


00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:49.720
Check it.


00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.020
And then the little cup, the other little cup.


00:45:52.020 --> 00:46:03.460
We're going to calibrate our pH meters because they're all...


00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:06.380
So this should be 4 and it's at 3.9.


00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.940
For me that tolerance is good.


00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.500
This one...


00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.500
So we look at these two.


00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.900
13 and 2.


00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:13.900
That's very, very uncalibrated.


00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:18.420
But some people, like if you don't check it, you just take out your pH meter and you don't


00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.420
have any information.


00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:23.340
(speaking in foreign language)


00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:33.480
And so, so, so yours is up to you.


00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:43.660
So I wanna see the ones that are the most off.


00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:45.060
All right, look at this one.


00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.980
Look at my probe.


00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:51.980
compared to this probe.


00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.980
Oh, it's dirty?


00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:54.980
Yeah.


00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:55.980
Like hazy?


00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:57.980
It's dark.


00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:58.980
It's stained.


00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:01.980
It's either from coffee or corroded.


00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:07.980
So if that were cleaned right after use,


00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:08.980
would that not be a good thing?


00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:09.980
Three points of stain.


00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.980
Or do you clean it when you use it?


00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:13.980
Do you mean three points of stain?


00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.980
Well, I don't know.


00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:16.980
It keeps going up.


00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:17.980
It goes up and down?


00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:18.980
Well, no.


00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:19.980
I wanted to show you these two.


00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:20.980
That's not cleaning.


00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:21.980
Yes.


00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:22.980
So this one gives me four and this one gives me 13.


00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:23.980
So when it's dirty that way, it's a problem.


00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:24.980
Can you fix that?


00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:25.980
It depends how old the probe is.


00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:26.980
So you put, if we put his in a soaking, in a cleaning solution, usually like overnight,


00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:27.980
you need several hours for it to work.


00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:28.980
And then try it again, maybe it'll clean up.


00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:29.980
So you put it in a soaking solution, and then you put it in a cleaning solution, and then


00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.980
you put it in a cleaning solution.


00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:31.980
And then you put it in a cleaning solution, and then you put it in a soaking solution.


00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:32.980
And then you put it in a cleaning solution, and then you put it in a cleaning solution.


00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.980
It depends how old the probe is.


00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.580
So you put, if we put his in a soaking, in a cleaning solution, usually like overnight,


00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:44.280
you need several hours for it to work.


00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.280
And then try it again, maybe it'll clean up.


00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.380
Maybe that's just, it was just dirty, or it could just be that it's old.


00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.980
So over time, pH probes do not last that long.


00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.980
You should change them out more frequently.


00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:56.980
How long have you had this one?


00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:58.980
A long time.


00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:00.980
What was the reading in that one?


00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:02.980
Two.


00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.980
But it's not like you can calibrate it once.


00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:09.980
You can't calibrate it if you see which doctor should do it three times.


00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:18.980
You can calibrate it, but sometimes it's so old that it doesn't adapt to the new one or the correct calibration.


00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.980
And another problem is that it can be calibrated very quickly.


00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:25.900
(speaking in foreign language)


00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:30.900
If it's something medical, something very important, it's calibrated before each measurement.


00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:35.900
If it's something more relaxed, like coffee, I do it once a day, once every day.


00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:41.900
But the older, the longer my tachometer is, I don't do it every day.


00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:49.900
So, that effort of calibrating every day, twice a day, is not worth it.


00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:51.900
Yes, it is heated.


00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.900
The amount of coffee we put, what was the ratio?


00:48:54.900 --> 00:49:00.900
Enough to lower the temperature to 5 or 8 degrees.


00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:07.900
So, there, because of the size of the container, if I had a smaller container,


00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:13.900
I would buy a bigger one to put more coffee to lower the temperature.


00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.900
So the objective of the coffee is to lower the temperature.


00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:20.820
(speaking in foreign language)


00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:27.820
It depends on the quantity where we are starting and also the ambient temperature and the coffee's temperature.


00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:32.820
So, it's a test of error to see if it's right.


00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:34.820
Yes.


00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.820
Because on a colder day, it could have lost a lot more temperature.


00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:38.820
Yes.


00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:40.820
Exactly.


00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:49.820
So, this step of adding coffee is not always necessary if the temperature of the yeast is low enough or if the coffee is hotter.


00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:58.800
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:01.480
Yeah, so coffee's not always necessary to add.


00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.640
It's just because it was so warm.


00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.080
And our environment is really warm, so it's not cooling.


00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:08.080
If it was a colder day and it just


00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.480
lowered its temperature on its own,


00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.640
we wouldn't need to do this.


00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.880
This is just an extra step because the coffee's cold


00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:17.400
and the yeast is warm, and we don't want to shock her.


00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.400
So where's my one that works?


00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.380
Not this one.


00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:29.360
I need to find my one that's like this.


00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:36.360
I think it's this one.


00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.360
[INAUDIBLE]


00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:38.360
[INAUDIBLE]


00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:41.340
[INAUDIBLE]


00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:44.320
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:47.300
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.740
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.740
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.740
And for me, it's 3.9.


00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:55.240
I'm going to go to the next step.


00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.740
But there are others who want to know how it's exact.


00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:01.740
And they say, well, that's true.


00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.740
Because each point in pH is 10 points.


00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:06.740
It's not 1, it's a logarithm of 10.


00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:11.740
So between 1 point is much more than just 1.


00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:17.740
So this is the safest.


00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.740
So I'm going to go to the next step.


00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:23.740
This is lemon juice.


00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.740
Lemon from my house.


00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.740
And the pH is at 2.


00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:35.740
So this is lemon juice from lemons that we took from our house and the pH is at 2.


00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:41.740
So what I want to do is remove mucilage mechanically.


00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:45.740
Can you bring me the both citrus containers?


00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:53.740
So yesterday we talked about fermentation being the traditional view of just removing the mucilage.


00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:57.740
Just getting my seed out and freeing it from the fruit.


00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:04.740
So this method, it's very confusing because the citric method is just about mechanically removing.


00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:07.740
There should be no citric influence on the coffee.


00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:35.740
[Spanish]


00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:37.980
(coughing)


00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:59.520
(speaking in Spanish)


00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:03.860
You already know that the coffee is very sticky.


00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.440
- I'll help you.


00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:12.220
(speaking in foreign language)


00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:13.820
- Does this need to be,


00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:15.620
why don't you just use citric acid?


00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:19.700
- A little powder?


00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:24.200
So, (speaking in foreign language)


00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.100
or orange.


00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:30.580
Citric acid.


00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:37.420
I've never tried it, but we're gonna try it.


00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:42.520
(speaking in foreign language)


00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:44.360
- Mandarin. - Mandarin, uh-huh.


00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:48.280
(speaking in foreign language)


00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.620
So we're gonna take a break, put this in the yeast,


00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:14.260
and we're gonna come back to this one.


00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:17.420
(audience chattering)


00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:27.540
So if you want, let's do the math.


00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:31.340
It's seven kilos of cold coffee,


00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:32.900
and we added two liters of syrup.


00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.620
So it was just to get to cover it.


00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:36.620
It's more about volume.


00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:38.780
Wait, like I just need enough liquid to cover it?


00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.660
- I'm at the 75 meter square.


00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:43.300
- Oh, yeah, exactly.


00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.620
Yeah, this is just,


00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:55.340
who's going to,


00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.820
Tomarco, you get the plunger.


00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:59.720
Very carefully, very slowly.


00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:01.620
Take our baby.


00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:05.540
Be nice to her.


00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:11.660
Yes, you can take it off. This is not lactic. This is a label.


00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:16.660
Let's go to the tank.


00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:20.660
Don't cross yourself!


00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.660
I'm very honest.
