00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.740
It's over there.


00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.240
Here?


00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.740
Yes.


00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.740
They already have the yeast.


00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.740
It's over there.


00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.740
OK.


00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:55.740
I'm going to take the machine from here.


00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.740
Thank you very much.


00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.740
Excuse me.


00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.660
(speaking in foreign language)

(speaking in foreign language)


00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.100
(speaking in foreign language)


00:01:37.100 --> 00:02:03.100
[Spanish]


00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.180
So the two things that are important, one is we can't make the yeast too much in


00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.100
advance because we need to have our full coffee and we make the yeast based on


00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.340
how much coffee we have. So we can't just start rehydrating some guests and then


00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.500
we could waste a lot of yeast. So you're gonna have to time it. The other


00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.780
thing that's important is we pulped without water but now I want a little


00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.140
bit more because I want it all to be covered. So now we can add a little bit


00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.140
more water because here we have some coffee underwater and some coffee above water.


00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.140
So I just want this to be really evenly distributed.


00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.140
Again, a better pulper would have a lot less cascara.


00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.140
So, like I said, this is just, we're working with what we got.


00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.140
This is not demonstration purposes.


00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.140
Demonstration purposes only.


00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.140
This is not Lucia's recommended.


00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.300
My recommendation is to take this out as much as you can.


00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:09.200
So now we're going to add the yeast to here very slowly.


00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.200
You're gonna pour it in very slowly.


00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.200
So we have to mix the two things at the same time so that everything is mixed.


00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:31.200
We are running and we are going to put it on this side.


00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.200
But you always put this at the beginning, right?


00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.400
(we did it this time because the temperature was 36 and the coffee was 22)


00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.920
(so if the coffee was hotter or the temperature was lower it's not necessary)


00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.040
(it's an extra step to avoid that shock)


00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.040
(you take it out)


00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.040
(use every drop)


00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:05.680
(you can keep doing it)


00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.160
[INAUDIBLE]


00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:38.160
[Splashing]


00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:54.160
[Spanish]


00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:05.160
So this is a small scale. We did half a ton. If we have twice the amount of coffee, it's better to have two smaller tanks that you can mix than one large one that's really hard to move.


00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.800
heavy. So that makes it look easy because it's very strong but it's very difficult


00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.040
to move this much coffee. If we had a really big beneficiary, let's say we have


00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.400
ten tubs and instead of having ten little tanks, one of the things that we


00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.640
can do is prepare our yeast and as the tank is filling we can dose it. So you


00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.200
can do a little bit of dosing the yeast as a tank is filling so that the mixing


00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.400
is a little bit easier but those are like the big the ones that I showed in


00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.880
Africa like swimming pool size tanks. But if you can,


00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.600
thoroughly mix it.


00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:56.200
So now we're going to let the yeast acclimate a little bit.


00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.160
What Ceas is doing is he's getting a cover. He's getting a plastic.


00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
How much do you have to eat?


00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
We're going to talk a little bit more and then we'll come back before lunch.


00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.160
And then we're going to get the pH and we're going to get the temperature and we're going to get the other measurements.


00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.160
Okay.


00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.160
So the size of that container, that was part of the formula that you said is in there?


00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.160
Mm-hmm.


00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:25.160
So yeah, this, we use two liters for 200 kilos of pulped coffee.


00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.160
Yeah.


00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
So this is about the size.


00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.000
Yeah.


00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.920
(speaking in foreign language)


00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:49.280
Yeah, it's nice to do it at night.


00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.040
Ideally, it's at night.


00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.840
Yes, it's a night job.


00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.040
Like I said, I'm only doing this


00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.440
'cause I didn't wanna keep you all up until 11.


00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.620
(speaking in foreign language)


00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.060
So this is, the goal is not to make this


00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.400
an anaerobic tight sealed fermentation.


00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.780
It's just to protect my coffee from anything,


00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.040
any birds flying, any insects,


00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.340
any cats that want to come smell this


00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.180
and stick their nose in here.


00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.540
And the other thing is the reason I'm touching the surface


00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.260
and skimming the surface is because I want


00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.120
all my coffee to be homogenous, right?


00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.180
So the coffee that's a couple layers underneath


00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.260
is completely submerged.


00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.860
If I do this, the top layer that would be exposed to air


00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.860
is now acting as if it's submerged


00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.780
without having too much water.


00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.140
So you wanna think of this as like a concentrate, a soup.


00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.860
If I have more water, it's easier to mix,


00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.900
but I'm diluting my flavors.


00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.160
So I want as little water as possible, but enough to cover.


00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.460
(speaking in foreign language)


00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.380
(speaking in foreign language)


00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.300
(speaking in foreign language)


00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.300
but not so much that it starts to dilute


00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:35.300
it's like making a soup or a very concentrated sauce


00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.300
It's important to measure it, it's important to see the amount of coffee


00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:45.300
Yes, the amount of coffee and in this way also with the plastic


00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:50.300
all the coffee, even if it doesn't have so much water, is submerged, is wet


00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.300
and is not exposed to that oxygen


00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.300
So now in your books, Maria, you have your bookshelf.


00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.300
We can fill it up to the top.


00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.300
Can we touch it?


00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.300
Yeah, you can touch it.


00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.300
We're all going to touch it.


00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.300
And then later we're going to open it up.


00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.300
So you're going to cover it and use the end of the fermentation?


00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.300
No.


00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.300
Yes, that's what we're going to talk about.


00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.300
So this is another big error that I see coffee producers making.


00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.300
They start their fermentation and then they don't open it again until the end.


00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.300
You're going to tell me if you're hungry.


00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.220
(speaking in foreign language)


00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:58.220
[Spanish]


00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:04.220
So that's a really big practice.


00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.540
A lot of producers start their fermentation,


00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.340
they seal it in those tanks,


00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.460
and then you're blind for another 48 hours


00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.300
or a couple of days.


00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.420
You don't know what's going on.


00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.900
I don't like that method.


00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.100
We're gonna see what's happening


00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.620
and we're gonna keep checking


00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.460
and see how the fermentation is going.


00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.700
So that's another reason I'm very anti


00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.420
those carbonic maceration, like sealed tanks,


00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.700
is because you're completely blind.


00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.220
You don't know what's happening,


00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.620
So you can't make adjustments to see, okay, is it getting too hot?


00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.320
Is it getting too cold?


00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.720
What's going to change my temperature?


00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.320
Is there a weird smell?


00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.320
Do I need to do something?


00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.520
Because you're just sealed the whole time.


00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:45.820
But I mean, can you just put the lid on, not lock it, just open up, I mean, time to time?


00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:50.520
Yes, but the whole point of the carbonic maceration is to keep that pressure and to keep that gas.


00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.320
So every time you open it, you're releasing all that gas.


00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.760
So you're not achieving the carbonic maceration effect.


00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.720
If you want just to do the fermentation of this,


00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.560
and instead of this plastic--


00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.120
You can use one of those tanks.


00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.240
Yeah, you can use anything.


00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.320
You can use a plastic bag.


00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.600
A lid.


00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.600
And yeah.


00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.840
But not just the lid.


00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.280
I want this plastic because I want it to touch the surface.


00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.360
If I just put a lid on top, I would have this much air space.


00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.040
I would have this much head space in contact.


00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.040
So all of this coffee on top would be different than the one on the bottom.


00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.540
And it's not that big of a deal.


00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:33.540
We're going to talk about geometry because it's a small surface area and a large volume.


00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.540
But most coffee tanks are what?


00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:36.540
Swimming pools.


00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.040
So you have very little volume and a lot of surface area.


00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.040
So your coffee on top is different than what's on the bottom.


00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.540
So this way I'm kind of combating the geometry of a traditional tank.


00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:55.540
Yes, we are. We're going to mix it. That's a big part of my method is mixing, homogenizing,


00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:03.140
and like I said, not being blind. Most of the methods, you put it in and then you come


00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.140
back in three days.


00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:11.140
Right? So now we're going to go back to the citric.


00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.140
That's the light.
