the yeast coffee that's on the raised bed,


00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.760
so you may have noticed that there used to be three beds

This is more of a, again, do as we say,


00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:46.440
not as we do because this coffee cannot be, there's no time to dry this coffee for us.


00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:51.440
This coffee is going to be sold wet. It's going to be sold anonymously to the co-op


00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:59.440
and they buy it by weight. So they sell, or we're going to sell wet parchment. And because


00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.440
they know that it's wet and they're not doing any quality, they just take half of the weight


00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:08.440
as water. So if we're drying it, then we're just losing money because they're just going


00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:13.240
reduce the weight in half. So we're re-soaking it to absorb water so that when we sell it


00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:21.160
we can make like four pennies more. So but we're saving one bin that I want to clean really really


00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:26.840
well and then just like this green you guys can take a sample finish drying at home and then you


00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:34.040
can have some of the yeast coffee. So hopefully over the next another 24 hours we'll get stable

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.700
Since we have so much less of that, like the yeast is for everybody.


00:25:52.700 --> 00:26:00.700
