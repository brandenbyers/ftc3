00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And definitely what's come up, I think two or three people have asked about it, is the


00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
eco-pulver and yeast are not a good blend because the whole point is to remove the mucilage


00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
mechanically, so you take away all the food, and then if you want to have a fermentation


00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
you're starving from the yeast.


00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So those two things do not work as a mesh.


00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And a lot of mills have moved over to an eco-pulver because it was more environmentally friendly


00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and it's less water because you don't have to wash the coffee maker.


00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's not that it doesn't do water.


00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's not that it doesn't do water.


00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So in this method, we're hoping without water, but then Jarmarko pointed out,


00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
"Okay, but there's water in the tank."


00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So if you get close, you see, that's not all juice.


00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
That's water that we've added back, because I do need water to be able to mix and move the yeast.


00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Because if we put the yeast on top, it's non-local.


00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's not going to move.


00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So the yeast is not going to go anywhere.


00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So I need water to mix and move.


00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This way I can control how much water.


00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Because what we've done other times is if the water, if the pulper is being pulped,


00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
the cherry is being pulped with water and it's also filling the tank,


00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
it can be too quick, too much, too quickly, and then it overflows.


00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So then we start to let out some of the water and then I'm letting go of some of those sugars


00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that I want for my fermentation.


00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So instead of pulping with water, we just add back a little bit.


00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
like it gives us more control later on.


00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
- But if you're a pulper, do you have to use some water?


00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.300
- When you're that big, usually you need the water


00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.320
to get the cherries to the pulper,


00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.560
and then it just kind of overflows.


00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.400
So at a very large scale, it's really difficult.


00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.840
We can try to turn it down,


00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.200
but a lot of them are so efficient in water,


00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.760
it's really hard to get them to dissolve.


00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.360
- Like a candy, for example,


00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.860
[INAUDIBLE]


00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.220
But then just take this water that you


00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.180
use for the production of the pomegranates,


00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.060
dump it back in the coffee mill.


00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.100
If there's a way, if it's a mill--


00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.380
and I've seen some that can capture--


00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.500
like, they're separating it, but you can capture it


00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.180
and add it back.


00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.700
I think that's a really good method.


00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.660
Some ones, because I haven't thought about that,


00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.580
it's way more effort to try and capture it,


00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.660
and you get more contamination because these grains


00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.820
are the ones that are going.


00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.820
So it really depends on how the beneficio was built.


00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.820
If it was built so you can recapture, great.


00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.820
And that's one thing when you're building a new place, a new facility,


00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.820
is thinking about how can you recapture some of this liquid


00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.820
to either put back into fermentation or just for wastewater purposes.


00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:46.820
The third thing to notice is there's a lot of gasketa in here.


00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.820
So what we really want is we just want the cherry, we just want the cold coffee and we


00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.820
want the skin to be on this side.


00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.820
So it should be much cleaner than this.


00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.820
This machine is, we had it in our garage, so it's not something that's in constant use


00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.820
and it's not very well calibrated.


00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.820
So this is not an example.


00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.820
You know, this is not what we want.


00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.820
This is not a great specialty coffee.


00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.460
So what we're going to do now to compensate that because I have so many hands here is


00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.460
we're going to clean it.


00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.460
We're going to try and take out as much of these by hand as we can to get our fermentation


00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.460
in a good place because what this is, remember this is all of the microbial competition.


00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:34.460
I'm adding yeast so I don't want all of this competing and making my fermentation more


00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.460
variable, more irregular.


00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.460
So, we have a couple of them over here.


00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:50.460
