00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[BLANK_AUDIO]


00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.560
So this is one of the questions that I get asked the most, the hardest for me to answer.


00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.480
What is yeast?


00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.800
I've just been with this question, what is life?


00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.840
What is a soul?


00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.520
I don't know how to explain to someone what yeast is.


00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.440
So mostly, what I want you to know about yeast is that, this,


00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.680
This can be instant, it's active, and it's alive.


00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.760
So it's an organism that is alive.


00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.880
It's somewhere in-- it's got its own category of aliveness


00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.520
that we'll see in a second.


00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.720
But the most important part is the alive.


00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.600
The reason I include the animal phylogeny chart as well


00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.400
is to think about the umbrella of animal


00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.120
encompasses a lot of different animals.


00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.080
Well, diversity is phenomenally huge.


00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.160
Yeast is similar.


00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.640
Oh, wow.


00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.080
That's very strong.


00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.480
The umbrella of yeast is equally a huge umbrella.


00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.760
There's huge diversity in yeast.


00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.880
A lot of the times we use yeast as one thing.


00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.520
Yeast is this one thing.


00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.040
I want people to understand that it is this umbrella term


00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.240
for a lot of diversity of microorganisms,


00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.040
the way that animal encompasses humans and elephants.


00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.440
And also, in the tree of life, animals and fungi


00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.280
are very close to each other.


00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.800
So earlier when we were rehydrating the yeast


00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.280
and I was talking about its feelings and being gentle


00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.360
and to thinking about its stress and thinking about its comfort


00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.600
and all of these kind of attributes,


00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.000
it's not just a quirk of mine.


00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.080
I do think of these as my pets.


00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.680
And I think that goes a long way into thinking about the care


00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.880
of our fermentation. I care about the health of my fermentation, the way I care about the feelings of my yeast,


00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.740
because these two organisms are very close on the whole tree of life. So it's not an unfair comparison.


00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.200
And the other thing I will bring up,


00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.280
so going this way, is that a lot of times


00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.760
yeast cells are used in a lot of studies because they resemble animal cells very, very closely.


00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.960
So this is a very well-studied organism and just kind of gives people a little bit of a background as to why I treat


00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.880
the way that I do and the other thing I include is


00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.640
kind of this little bit parsing out a lot of the times we're using yeast too broadly, too general and


00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:47.960
This is a little bit more in Spanish that kind of all of these words are just "hormos"


00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.920
Mushroom is an ongo and then a mold is an ongo and then a yeast is an ongo and the whole category


00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.300
So in Spanish, we're very limited in our vocabulary and it's hard because a lot of the times we want


00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:11.600
We want to be technical and we're using technical terms and we don't realize how often our coffee terms are very slangy or colloquial


00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.360
or just very very regional


00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.420
So I just want to bring some awareness to the language that we're using and when we're mixing our technical words


00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.800
and when we're mixing our local words and where we're just kind of


00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.640
Making stuff up because all of this gets blended. So we've kind of the theme is like we have a very unique foundation for coffee


00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.340
There's a lot of people


00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.660
Especially potentially consumers people on the outside think coffee is a very well-developed industry and they're just like not aware


00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.660
"Oh, I just haven't learned these things yet."


00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.660
But most of the, most professional producers, you know, fifth generation people that have done this their whole lives


00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.660
also don't know these words and don't know the terminology and get all of this stuff really mixed up.


00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.660
So, it's kind of a proceed with caution scenario.


00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.660
And to not really take for granted when people are using these words.


00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.660
You know, it's perfectly okay to say, "What do you mean by that?"


00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.660
"What does that mean to you?"


00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.660
"What does that mean?"


00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.780
So that means, like we were talking about lulum,


00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.620
which is the juice that we had.


00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.580
And we're like, well, what do you call this in Ecuador?


00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.900
What do you call this in Mexico?


00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.820
And like, we all have different words for the same fruit.


00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.500
So it's really nice to be able to take a pause


00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.700
and say, what do you mean by that?


00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.260
So this is what I mean by yeast.


00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.420
This is what I mean by these microorganisms.


00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.100
So along those lines that yeast cells


00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.020
are very similar to human cells,


00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.020
I think about these things. I'm very concerned about my yeast in terms of my fermentation.


00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.020
I care about the environment. So what am I bringing my yeast to? How gentle am I waking them up?


00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.020
The other thing is if we had yeast in the refrigerator, coming from a cold place,


00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.020
and then I'm going to shock it with warm water, and then I'm going to put it in a cold tank.


00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.020
These are the things that I think about.


00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.020
So yeast is a fungi?


00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.020
Yes.


00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.020
Okay.


00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.020
Exactly.


00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.420
I think about my temperature, right?


00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.920
So, is it too hot, is it too cold?


00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.380
Where am I storing my yeast?


00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.460
How is my fermentation?


00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.760
Is too much heat going to be stressful?


00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.060
Or is too much cold going to be stressful?


00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.580
We can think about yeast having behavior.


00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.540
There are some yeasts that are very aggressive.


00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.180
Sema is a very aggressive yeast.


00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.180
We've seen the bubbles when it was rehydrating.


00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.980
We saw there was a lot of activity.


00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.980
There's a lot of bubbles.


00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.060
It dominates the fermentation really strongly


00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.660
and very completely.


00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.000
And there's other yeasts that are very timid.


00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.800
that take longer to build up their biomass


00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.680
and take longer to start their fermentation process.


00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.360
So I do think of yeast as having personalities.


00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.120
Some are aggressive, some are shy,


00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.520
some are really delicate.


00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.800
You have to have this really narrow temperature window.


00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.240
Others are like bulldozers


00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.400
and they can just tolerate all of these temperature extremes.


00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.720
These are all things to keep in mind


00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.080
when we're just using the one word of yeast.


00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.000
Stress is also kind of lack,


00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.320
Things that can be stressful are lack of food.


00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.360
So if you're coming into a really nutrient depleted media,


00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.200
meaning maybe it's a farm that hasn't had the money


00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.560
to fertilize, that they've missed several cycles,


00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.560
that the coffee is very weak plants.


00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.240
Just like we can have a poorly, low nutrition,


00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.280
high stress plant, we can have a low nutrition,


00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.880
high stress fermentation.


00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.640
These things correlate pretty well.


00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.680
And then also competition.


00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.600
So this is competition in terms of microbial competition.


00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.200
All of the other microbes that are coming in from the field


00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.440
competing with the yeast that I'm trying to introduce.


00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.040
So am I giving it difficult conditions?


00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.240
Like, am I starting it out in like,


00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.480
in a gentle and kind of a way that it can flourish?


00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.920
Or am I giving the yeast a lot of challenges?


00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.920
Challenges with temperature,


00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.480
challenges with not enough food,


00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.960
challenges with not enough nutrients.


00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.960
So in terms of nutrition, in wine fermentation,


00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.640
it is basic that we add nutrients.


00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.060
We inoculate with yeast and we add nutrients


00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.080
to our fermentation.


00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.080
These go hand in hand.


00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.320
You don't do one without the other.


00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.680
Because a wine fermentation is very long.


00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.240
You want these yeast to survive for two weeks,


00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.880
four weeks, and if you have a really cold,


00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.600
cool white wine fermentation, you can have five weeks.


00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.520
So you can have 35 days of fermentation.


00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.240
that yeast is gonna need a lot of help along that way.


00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.020
In coffee, our fermentations are 24 hours, 36 hours,


00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.880
they're much shorter.


00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.680
So the added cost of nutrients is a hard pill to swallow.


00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.080
When the cost of yeast is,


00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.920
the cost of fertilizer is already a big barrier,


00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.880
and now you're gonna have yeast,


00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.700
and now you're saying,


00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.840
"Well, now we need to buy a yeast nutrient."


00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.200
It's a lot.


00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.600
But if you're having stressed, difficult fermentations,


00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.240
that's one place to potentially invest.


00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.160
So it's not, again, the first place to start,


00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.520
but a lot of producers are the bigger ones


00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.920
that have more resources have started


00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.200
to buy some yeast nutrient to help


00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.080
their fermentations along.


00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:14.720
So this picture is a mill that I worked at in El Salvador,


00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.680
and this is kind of to show also the scale.


00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.160
So this fermentation has yeast in it.


00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.320
We did the yeast fermentation,


00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.420
'cause I had to, 'cause I was hired to go there and do that,


00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.100
but I wouldn't let them use the other tank.


00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.820
They wanted to fill up the whole Beneisio.


00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.780
Because so often, they're trying to use yeast,


00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.140
they're putting in this investment,


00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.700
it's much more advanced,


00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.460
but the basics haven't been covered.


00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.820
That tank is a completely different situation,


00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.420
temperature, than the one on the side.


00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.020
So a lot of the times as producers,


00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.620
we kind of overlook the more basic things.


00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.060
We kind of try to run before we can walk.


00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.660
So here it's in open air.


00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:57.100
it's very hot. So for me, I'm like, before you buy yeast, like maybe build a wall.


00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:01.220
Or let's have a roof. You know, like I think about the structure and the


00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:09.820
protection before we go to this like next level solutions. And even though I


00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.660
only let them use this one tank that was in the shade, it's still part of my tank


00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.940
is in the sun. So this slice of my fermentation is at a completely different


00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:23.180
temperature and environment than the rest of it. So too often we think of like


00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:27.420
one fermentation, one mass. There's all these layers of different things that


00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:33.420
are going on. So one fermentation is not just one result. So in our yeast


00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.660
today we saw that the outer edge of the tank was at a different temperature than


00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:42.300
the inner part. We are inoculating, so that temperature difference doesn't


00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:48.540
bother me so much because I have added the yeast, I'm dominating, I'm minimizing those


00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.580
effects. But if I wasn't adding yeast, if it was just the wild yeast that was coming


00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:58.380
in from the field, there would be a different one on the outside, as the inside, as the


00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:03.500
top, as the bottom, and so I would be having 15 different fermentations depending on the


00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:12.140
geometry of my tang. And that really affects your consistency and your cup-to-cup variability.


00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.620
So it's something you can manage.


00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.540
You can jacket your tank, you can have temperature control,


00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.540
that we talked about with Caleb earlier today.


00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.580
You can manage your, you can put,


00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.260
well, what's your design idea?


00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.540
What have you thought about?


00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.980
- I thought about just using a, like,


00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.940
copper tube heat exchanger,


00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:35.420
and then pumping either hot or cold water through it,


00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.060
so making like a big coil that just goes in the tank,


00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.860
and then having temperature controllers


00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:47.460
control pumps that will either come out of the cold water through the boil as a heat exchange.


00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:52.820
That's really brilliant. I love that idea. I would love to see that kind of come to life


00:10:52.820 --> 00:11:00.100
because it's a huge concern in these fermentations. They can, in a small container, they can vary


00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:05.780
dramatically. So imagine multiply by two tons, five tons, these giant eggs. Your temperature


00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.380
gradient is going to be much bigger and your variation is going to be much greater.


00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:17.780
So would that change if you're able to like somehow like stir it around like frequently?


00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.380
Potentially. If you're stirring frequently, then you are homogenizing the temperature.


00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.500
So you know, can you stir often enough to compensate for how quickly it'll warm up?


00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.220
Right. You have to have somebody like walking through that the whole time.


00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:35.060
Maybe. I mean, maybe it's slow enough that it may, you know, it would depend. But I think


00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:39.540
if you just stay in front of that, if you can mix faster, then it warms up.


00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:47.060
Yeah. Yes. Usually like mixing is supposed to slow it down a bit because for example if we're


00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:52.660
thinking about the sourdough, so you fold the bread like for example four or five times during


00:11:52.660 --> 00:12:03.060
straining, so you're basically a bit like slowing down the how fast the fermentation of the bread


00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:09.700
happens. Potentially. So with these yeast, mixing can do one of two things. First, you're homogenizing


00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.980
your temperature, which is great, but you could be disrupting your activity. So in sourdough,


00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.580
that's what we want. We want to kind of interrupt that. We're changing the structure of those


00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.420
proteins. You want to make different connections, and we're trying to get that structure. So you are


00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:28.100
interrupting, disrupting a process. But potentially, a lot of these yeast, which we'll see a little bit


00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:35.100
a little bit later, need a little bit of oxygen for their regeneration to create new generations.


00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:40.100
So you could be feeding them micro-dosing oxygen to help them grow faster.


00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:46.100
So, biology we can do both. We can disrupt the system with the same action or we could


00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.100
be accelerating the system with that same action. So mixing is kind of one of those


00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.100
like, it depends. It depends on what we're trying to accomplish and it depends on what's


00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.260
what's present there if it's a disruption and slowing down or if it's accelerating and


00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:03.380
getting more of a reaction. And the only way to know that is to try it? The only way to know that


00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:10.020
is to try it or to be really aware of what microbe you're adding. So like how we were adding the sema


00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:15.140
I know that with this Saccharomyces cerevisiae it needs a micro dose of oxygen when it's mixing


00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:21.940
and helping it regenerate more because I know this one. Is it going to still be called anaerobic?


00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.220
So we will get there. So hold that thought.


00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:36.020
So this is just a review of what we did this morning of your math of you know 100 kilos of


00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:43.700
bulk coffee so one to one kilo grams of yeast times 10 of water and then your water is based


00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:48.500
on your grams of yeast 37 Celsius. So this is just a summary of what we did this morning.


00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.020
But is we measure in pergamino or in cherry?


00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.020
Pergamino.


00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.020
Pergamino.


00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.540
Well, it's mass of whatever you're using.


00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:02.260
So if you were going to do a cherry fermentation, you would do kilos of cherry to yeast.


00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:08.340
Which is why I don't recommend yeast with naturals because you're using twice the yeast


00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.100
because your mass is double and then you're just going to throw half of it away later.


00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:16.940
So you're like throwing away twice as much yeast because you're getting rid of that half


00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:22.500
of that coffee mass. So yeah, it's one of those things that this is already


00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:30.380
expensive, so to do it on cherries is more double the cost if you're trying to


00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:35.460
control, if you're trying to control the process. So one of the ways that you can


00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.580
use yeast is as a bio control, meaning I want to reduce what's coming in from the


00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:45.740
field, and you're using it as like, like insurance, and not necessarily because


00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.920
you want these flavors to dominate, but it's more of an insurance to prevent


00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:53.760
defects and prevent like some unknowns coming in from the field. So it's not


00:14:53.760 --> 00:15:00.920
that it has no use, but it's not its best use. It's not the best. For me it's not


00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.040
worth it for the kind of application that I'm trying to do, which is have


00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:11.240
maximum impact on the flavor. So doing it in cherry is like starting a race kind


00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.240
behind. It's like I want to get to my seed as soon as possible.


00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.240
My method.


00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.240
Oh yeah.


00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.240
Yesterday, you said you had a little bit of a chewy bite,


00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.240
and there's going to be a lot of microorganisms,


00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.240
and you're going to increase your dosage a little bit.


00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.240
How do you calculate that?


00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.240
It's just experience. So sometimes when I go to a mill


00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.240
that uses recycled water, so I know the charge is higher than


00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.400
is higher than recycled water, because they use it


00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.360
for a couple of batches.


00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.280
If I see that there's a lot of overripes,


00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.560
if I see that their tanks are really dirty,


00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.640
and I have to use yeast--


00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.600
first, I'm like, OK, let's stop and not do this.


00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.760
But if I have to, then that's when


00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.000
I would increase the dosage.


00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.080
And it's not like, if I see this dirty tank, I add 20%.


00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.200
It's just like a feeling.


00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.440
I'm like, a little bit more.


00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.000
It's just like an experience of like,


00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.520
want to give the yeast a little bit more of a chance because there's so much pressure


00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:18.000
from either the dirtiness of the tank, the reused water, the cherry that's coming in,


00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000
like all of these sources. So yeah, I don't have a specific answer. It's just like I eyeball it and I feel it out.


00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
But we shouldn't use less than this, right?


00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:37.000
We shouldn't use less. So we'll talk about that a little bit later as well, but yeah, that's a really important point that because the yeast is so expensive


00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.540
And we're like, well, I'll just use half,


00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.800
or I'll just use a little bit so that I can just stretch it.


00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.200
And for me, stretching, you might as well not use any,


00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.040
because the point of the yeast is consistency


00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.680
and domination.


00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.680
And if you underdose, you don't dominate,


00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.560
so you don't have consistency.


00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.640
So then why are you using the yeast?


00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.600
Just wing it.


00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.800
So either use none or have your current dosage.


00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.660
For me, underdosing really defeats the purpose.


00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.020
'Cause you don't have that confidence.


00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.900
It's like, it's the same with the pH meter.


00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.220
If you're gonna have a pH meter, great,


00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.460
but if you're not gonna calibrate it,


00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.020
then your pH meter's not giving you any confidence


00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.420
about what you're measuring.


00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:23.440
- But if someone wants to, like,


00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.300
expand it first, I mean, the yeast,


00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.460
that is so expensive.


00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.300
- Yeah.


00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.520
- You start growing, I mean,


00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.740
I mean, like, before...


00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:34.740
Like a mother culture.


00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:41.740
Yeah, and then, I mean, you can, like, you can increase, I mean, you can expand the use


00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.740
before using it.


00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:43.740
Yeah.


00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:44.740
Do you recommend it?


00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.740
That, I do not.


00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.740
I do not recommend it, and I'll tell you why a little bit later.


00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.740
But, again, it's like the lesser of two evils.


00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:58.740
If you're going to, like I talk a lot about, you know, abstinence is not a solution.


00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.740
You have to teach safe sex.


00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:04.740
You can't teach abstinence, so I wish you wouldn't do that.


00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.740
But if you're going to do it, that's a better way to do it.


00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:13.740
If you need to stretch your yeast, it's better to grow it up than it is to underdose.


00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:19.740
So if you're going to save money, better grow it up, have a stronger culture, use it twice,


00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.740
instead of using half a dose two times.


00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.740
>> [INDISTINCT] >> Yeah.


00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:25.740
>> Like extrapolating from other kinds of fermentation like bread, like foolish or something like


00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:26.740
kind of growing out that yeast in a smaller and then adding that to the larger flour,


00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.740
like, it totally makes sense but like where does it break down, like where is the difference


00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.740
with like flour versus...


00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:29.740
>> Well, it's not the flour...


00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.740
>> Versus the yeast.


00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:31.740
>> Versus the flour.


00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:32.740
>> Yeah.


00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:33.740
>> It's the yeast.


00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:34.740
>> Yeah.


00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.740
>> Yeah.


00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.740
>> Yeah.


00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.740
>> So, I mean, I mean, I think it's a little bit like the, you know, the--I mean, I think


00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.740
it's a little bit like the--I mean, I think it's a little bit like the--I mean, I think


00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:39.740
it's a little bit like the--I mean, I think it's a little bit like the--I mean, I think


00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.700
and kind of growing out that yeast in a smaller amount,


00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.500
adding that to the larger flour,


00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.580
didn't totally make sense, but where does it break down?


00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.100
Where is the difference with flour versus--


00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.620
- Well, it's not the flour--


00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.140
- Or is it a consistency thing?


00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:55.980
It's just too much of a difference.


00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.300
- For me, it's a consistency thing.


00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:02.780
So with these sourdough cultures that are 100 years old,


00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.980
that have just decades old cultures,


00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.420
it's very valuable and it works really well in bread,


00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:13.220
Because what we really want to do with bread is we want this transformation.


00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.220
We want that gas formation.


00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.720
We want the rise, which is a very small ask for yeast.


00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.520
I mean, that's a primary metabolism.


00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.420
The yeast, for many generations, is going to break down sugars


00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.620
and produce carbon dioxide and alcohol.


00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.120
You'll get those bubbles.


00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.520
But what we're asking the yeast to do for these fermentations


00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.020
is a secondary metabolism.


00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.120
So producing the esters, the thiols, all of these compounds


00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.220
that we want to give flavor,


00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.740
you have a limited amount of generations


00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.180
that the yeast can do that.


00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.580
So in bread, we're always asking for the primary,


00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.740
not that you don't get really complex flavors as well,


00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.620
but the demand on those yeast is much lower.


00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.180
Like just rise, give me carbon dioxide.


00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.420
And here I'm like, I want esters.


00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.220
And so the limited generation.


00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.300
So we'll cover that also a little bit later,


00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.580
but it's intuitive, but it doesn't translate.


00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.080
(dog barking)


00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.000
Oh, my God.


00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.420
This was just to talk about the temperature again,


00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.580
to make sure that the yeast that I'm adding


00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.820
is not so much warmer than my coffee and shoxanthin.


00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.180
In this one, you can see there's coffee in my jar,


00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.220
and then we added it.


00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.540
So it's the idea of being gentle,


00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.460
being very thoughtful about how we're treating the yeast


00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.460
so that we have a good fermentation and that they're healthy.


00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:45.460
This is just the summary. I like this as a memorization 1 to 1, 1 to 10, 37 degrees, 20 minutes, less than 10 degrees Celsius.


00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.460
And this is in your book, so...


00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.460
[inaudible]


00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.460
Yeah, it's your book.


00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.460
So how much of the coffee do you put into the...


00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.460
Enough to...


00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.460
Into the mousse?


00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.460
To lower the temperature. So that's a guess and check. We kind of eyeball it.


00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:05.900
it. See, because also I don't know how much you need to drop. I don't know if you need to drop


00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.940
five Celsius or if you need to drop two to be within range or if it's really hot. So you would


00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:18.220
just add more or less until you get to that temperature. But then also leaving these time


00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:24.060
to acclimate. So don't just drop the temperature and add it. Drop the temperature, wait, and then


00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.220
And then add it.


00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:31.500
And sometimes-- and this has happened--


00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.180
that the point of adding the coffee


00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.100
is to drop the temperature.


00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.760
But again, if we're not paying attention


00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.980
and we leave too much time, it starts to ferment really


00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.740
quickly and the temperature can go back up


00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.020
if you're not paying attention.


00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.660
So instead of dropping it, we're increasing the temperature.


00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.300
So it's just keeping an eye, having timers,


00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.300
and not letting it go too long.


00:21:52.300 --> 00:22:00.900
This is just a reminder, we talked about this a lot, but the lactic fermentation, we're


00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.900
just changing the environment.


00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.900
We didn't add lactic bacteria.


00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:03.900
We are just setting the party and inviting our lactic bacteria friends.


00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:04.900
We're inhibiting yeast and we're encouraging the lactic acid bacteria.


00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:05.900
And usually what you can expect are some pretty flavors from this method.


00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.900
One of the things that was asked was, "Okay, so what's the best way to get rid of lactic


00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:07.900
bacteria?"


00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.900
And I said, "Well, you can get rid of lactic bacteria by adding lactic acid."


00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:09.900
And I said, "Okay, so what's the best way to get rid of lactic acid?"


00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.900
And they said, "Well, you can get rid of lactic acid by adding lactic acid."


00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:11.900
And I said, "Okay, so what's the best way to get rid of lactic acid?"


00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:16.280
yeast and we're encouraging the lactic acid bacteria and usually what you can


00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:21.520
expect are some pretty flavors from this method. One of the things that was asked


00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.080
was okay so if it's a lactic process are we getting more lactic acid in our cup


00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.960
and I can't say that because yes the lactic acid bacteria are producing more


00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.280
lactic acid in our fermentation but you still have to roast it so acids are the


00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.480
first thing to get degraded in our roasting so I can't say more acid here


00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:45.480
survives to the cut. I don't know. It'll depend on your roasting style.


00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.480
Anything to add?


00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:55.480
[inaudible]


00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.480
That would be very expensive.


00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:05.480
So the yeast we can dry and send in this powdered form and you can have a lot of,


00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.680
you can reduce cost that way.


00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.560
The bacteria are much more delicate,


00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.260
so you need to keep them in a high moisture environment.


00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.840
So you would have to ship them with liquid.


00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.800
We'd have to ship like a one gallon,


00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:22.200
like re-humidified, re-hydrated solution,


00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.600
which is 10 times more expensive.


00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.240
So if the yeast is already very expensive,


00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:31.700
then a bacterial culture will be 10X or 15X.


00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:35.860
And if you dry the bacteria, it's freeze-dry,


00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.340
then it has to be frozen.


00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.660
So then you have to ship it with dry ice.


00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.940
So either way, it's expensive,


00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.540
whether you're rehydrated in water or dry ice.


00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.020
So bacteria is, I love bacteria,


00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.980
I just don't work with it because yeast is so much easier


00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.900
to keep for three years in your backpack.


00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:57.660
Like it's kind of the lowest common denominator.


00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:58.820
The bacteria is great.


00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.660
Maybe you live near a bacteria factory.


00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.860
Maybe you live somewhere where you can have that.


00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:08.100
- And for the yeast, I mean, can we just, I mean,


00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:11.140
buy that bag and then keep going?


00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.380
It's usually like forever, is it possible?


00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.300
No?


00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.980
- No, and that's a good thing,


00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.020
because a lot of concerns for producers


00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.940
are invasive species.


00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.860
So I'm gonna bring this yeast that's kind of,


00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.700
from a different country, from a different place,


00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:28.820
and I'm gonna bring it to my mill,


00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.300
and I'm gonna use it once,


00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.820
and then it's gonna live forever,


00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.140
and then it's gonna like contaminate.


00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:37.260
So in a way, it's kind of like a protection.


00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.140
You don't want these to live forever.


00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:44.140
You want there to be some kind of like limiting step.


00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.060
So the cynical answer is no,


00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.420
because the companies wanna make money.


00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.380
So if they sold you something once,


00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.860
then they would never sell another bag


00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.540
if that's not good for business.


00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:55.700
But the other sense too,


00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.500
is it is protecting the producer to say,


00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.100
well, I don't wanna use that yeast anymore.


00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.060
You stop using it.


00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:06.560
it's not going to colonize and take over your mill and you can use something else and you can have that variability.


00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:12.560
So both ways, you don't really want it to live forever, even if it is very inexpensive.


00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:26.060
And again, I need a different name for this process because the lactic fermentation does have higher lactic acid,


00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.580
And that is happening.


00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.940
The citric, we don't want to add citric acid.


00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.880
The whole point is that we don't taste the citric,


00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.460
but I don't have a good name for it.


00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.800
Like extreme acidification method.


00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.740
You know, like it doesn't sound as easy as citric method.


00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.940
- As a result of that, everyone will start using it.


00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.040
- Extreme acidification.


00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.180
So the whole point is to drop the acid fast


00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.500
so that there is no fermentation.


00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:56.500
because when we go from a pH of 6, 7 to 2 in a second,


00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.040
that eliminates a lot of microbes


00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.540
that just cannot adapt that quickly


00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.020
to that extreme acidification.


00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.800
So your risk of fermentation is much lower.


00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.860
It's higher with the juice


00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.600
because you still have all of that sugar


00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.460
that you brought in from the citrus.


00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.980
So if you leave it long enough,


00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.380
you may still have a fermentation that starts,


00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.180
a decomposition that starts.


00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.660
But that's not what I'm going for.


00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.340
I'm going for no effect.


00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.080
I'm going for naked coffee.


00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:31.300
I just wanna see what influence I have from the variety


00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.160
or my growing practices,


00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.760
or maybe changes that we're doing in the field.


00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.500
Can we taste more of the nutrition?


00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.500
Can we taste the difference in the shape,


00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.340
trees that we're growing?


00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.440
Something like that,


00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.360
where process is not influencing for better or worse.


00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:50.300
I recommend this for producers as just like,


00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:55.020
your control. What does our coffee look like? Just do a small batch and just get an idea of what does


00:26:55.020 --> 00:27:01.980
our tabby taste like, what does our caffeine taste like with nothing. Just to know. And because you


00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:07.660
can do it in such a small quantity, it's not, and it's so fast. You're not losing a lot of time


00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.460
to gain some of that insight. Yeah.


00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:16.060
Would there be any baggage to soaking it, let's say, six to ten hours after washing this?


00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.500
Like, you know, you bring your eggs and then you're...


00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.860
Soaking it in like clean water?


00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.380
Yeah.


00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:27.340
So the soaking in clean water would help you in terms of,


00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.820
if there is any influence of the citric,


00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.820
to even get it a little bit more clean.


00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.620
There's also an effect of soaking


00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.780
where some chlorogenic acid can come out.


00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.820
So maybe you can reduce your caffeine a little bit.


00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:45.020
And the other potential danger is


00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.860
you're going to be pulling out sugars.


00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.300
So the glucose and the fructose will be coming out


00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:54.900
in that sense. You could be losing some of those building blocks. So a little bit of a double-edged


00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.380
sword. Maybe it's not enough to make a difference and maybe it's better to have that clean.


00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:08.580
Experiment. So you do the citric right away, wash it, and then try another one something six hours


00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:15.380
or 12 hours. And taste those side by side. So this one is mainly if you receive the cherries


00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:20.020
the pulpit and wash it, you don't need to do this.


00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.420
A normal producer.


00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.700
- No, you don't need to do this.


00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:23.700
This is not necessary.


00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.020
This is just like a tool in your toolbox.


00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.860
We were talking with Valeria when she had a day


00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.740
where they just had so much cherry cob


00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.020
and they couldn't process it


00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.660
and they didn't have enough fermentation tanks


00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.340
and they didn't have space.


00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.700
This is a way where you can avoid defects


00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.980
because if you leave the coffee in the cherry


00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.460
sitting on a truck until you can get to it


00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.500
tomorrow, the next day, maybe nobody showed up.


00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:50.500
don't have any people to help you process it. This can help you save the coffee, which


00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.500
is your question. Tell us what happened.


00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.500
In the middle of pulping we had a power cut.


00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.500
They had a power cut, their power went out in the middle of pulping.


00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.500
Yeah. I saved half of it and gave away the other half.


00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:08.500
So he had his coffee, his power went out, and then he was afraid the coffee was going


00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.500
to spoil, so he gave it to a neighbor, right?


00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.500
One of my workers.


00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.500
One of his workers.


00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:20.500
So in this case, Cecil was worried about the quality of his coffee.


00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.500
My power's out, I can't process it, it's going to go bad.


00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.500
So he gave it away.


00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.500
So it was a missed opportunity for that coffee.


00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.500
So this gives you a little bit of that wiggle room.


00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.500
Or just soaking it in water. Something like that.


00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.500
So it's something that you can pull out in an emergency.


00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:42.500
It's something that you can see as a beginning of what does my variety taste like.


00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.220
like, or it could let you know, maybe I want to buy an eco pulper.


00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.740
Maybe I do want a machine that can do this for me.


00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:55.380
And before you spend $10,000 on a machine, just try this and see if I like it.


00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:00.580
Because one of the things that's happened is eco pulpers have become this like


00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.500
very controversial piece of equipment.


00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:08.980
So eco pulpers in Costa Rica, almost all of their production has moved because


00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.660
they're very environmentally friendly.


00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.300
coffee production uses a lot of water.


00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.260
And so they said, let's eliminate water as much as we can


00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.500
and we're gonna use this eco-pulver


00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.680
and we're gonna eliminate the fermentation.


00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.620
And their coffee improved, their coffee is excellent.


00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.660
So all like Costa Rican coffee producers


00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.260
say eco-pulvers are the best thing


00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.020
that's ever happened to coffee.


00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:33.260
And then they were like touting its like benefits


00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.100
and a lot of Latin producers


00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.580
who traditionally knew of fermentation


00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.220
bought these eco-pulvers.


00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.300
And they said, my coffee was excellent


00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.840
and now my coffee is boring and flat


00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.880
and my quality has gone down.


00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.720
They said eco-pulpers are the worst thing


00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.640
that has ever happened.


00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.440
You go to a lot of Latin producers


00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.680
and the eco-pulper is collecting dust in the corner,


00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.160
this expensive piece of equipment


00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.960
that they just don't use anymore.


00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.200
And so you have these two countries, two producers


00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.040
that swear that the best thing that ever happened,


00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.080
the worst thing that ever happened,


00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.440
and they're both completely correct.


00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.880
They're both actually correct.


00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.720
Because in Costa Rica, they use a lot of recycled water.


00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.720
So they were having this highly microbially charged water


00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.720
washing their coffee so that when they cut out


00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.000
the fermentation step, they eliminated defects.


00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.240
Their coffee got better and cleaner.


00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.480
But in a lot of Latin countries, we have so much water


00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.600
we don't know what to do with.


00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.760
There's so much water that we're drowning.


00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.720
And so when they stopped doing that fermentation,


00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.960
they didn't need to save water at that point.


00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.880
Like it was just sort of like,


00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.640
I don't know what to do with the extra water.


00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.520
So a lot of times the coffee was washed several times.


00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.320
And then when they limited the fermentation,


00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.160
their coffee was less complex, less interesting, less--


00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.720
I don't know, lower quality to them.


00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.760
So it depends on in what situation


00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.160
you introduce this machine.


00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.200
It can either really improve your coffee


00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.400
or be the worst thing that you've ever purchased.


00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.320
So it's still not like--


00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.120
I guess a lot of people still don't realize


00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.600
that there's that opportunity.


00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.040
And they're still like, EcoFulbridge


00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.120
are the best for water saving.


00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:12.120
Yes, but if you are in a situation where you can't sell your coffee for more and differentiate it, eco-pulpers are somewhat of an advantage.


00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:19.120
So it was the recycled water that made the real difference for Costa Rica and the rest of Latin America?


00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.120
I can't say for sure, but that's my guess.


00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:30.120
My experience seeing, working in Costa Rica, going to other countries, they have a much stronger emphasis,


00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:35.120
a much stronger, like, kind of governmental support to say, "This is how we're really--want


00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.120
to recycle this water, we really want to be conscious about this, everybody use recycled


00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:45.120
water," and kind of like a countrywide, like, unspoken mandate, like, "This is how we process


00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.120
coffee here." Make sense?


00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:56.120
>> Would it, in theory, at least, in Costa Rica, by any--if there was accessible water


00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.120
and it wasn't being recycled into good fermentation,


00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.120
that it could be even better than the eco-pulp?


00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:08.120
Or are there some areas that are just going to--the eco-pulp will just be better than that or what?


00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.120
Like...


00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.120
I don't think...


00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:17.120
I don't think no fermentation is ever better than a good fermentation.


00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.120
A good fermentation has a chance to add complexity,


00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.120
and no fermentation, well, you're kind of giving that up.


00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:28.120
But definitely no fermentation is better than a bad fermentation.


00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.120
So it's sort of like that kind of starting material.


00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:37.120
So I don't think it will ever be better if you're managing it well.


00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:42.120
I've got a question about the sesame seeds.


00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:47.120
Because you said that the powder went out and we didn't have a powder,


00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:53.120
so if we had a powder, which is not manpower, is there a way to make the sesame process?


00:33:53.120 --> 00:34:01.120
So what he could have done is soaked it in cool water to preserve the cherries and then


00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.120
maybe the next morning, so you would need the pulper to start working.


00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:10.120
So it would buy you time, but because you've already had the coffee soaking in the cherry


00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:15.120
or macerating in the cherry for so long, you may not then want to do an even longer fermentation


00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.120
afterwards.


00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:22.120
So the short could still help you to kind of recover some of that time.


00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:27.440
So let's say, unfortunately, maybe the coffee stayed 48 hours in its cherry because the


00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:31.920
power didn't come back for two days, but then if you do no fermentation, if you cut it off


00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.400
there, your total time is still 48, versus if you wait the 48 and then you have another


00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.800
three-day fermentation, now you're going on five days and you have more opportunity for


00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.720
defects or for something to go wrong.


00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:47.120
So yes, you still wouldn't use a citric on the cherries, but it could still help you.


00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:54.120
So like, to kind of like, break like, you're gonna crash and then you just right at the


00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.120
end kind of come back.


00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.120
Yeah.


00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:03.120
So this kind of gets to this point of like, well what's better?


00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.120
Eco-pulp work, fermentation, no fermentation.


00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.120
And then the question is, what is the role of processing?


00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.120
What is the point?


00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:13.120
And not everybody in the Spanish group knows what James Hoffman is, but I assume most of


00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:19.600
So most of the people here have heard of James Hoffman as a very influential person, coffee personality.


00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.640
And so


00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.960
this is a quote of his that I found.


00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:32.660
So I still believe that creation of quality ends the moment you pick a coffee and that every single step afterward is about preservation and transparency.


00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:39.600
Except the natural process. So let's just stick on this preservation and transparency. So I have like the cherry like in ice.


00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.640
So this is a very common view


00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.200
that also related to what producers were being told.


00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.240
So producers were being told,


00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.800
we talked about this yesterday,


00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.240
process as quickly as possible, get out of the way,


00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.960
all you can do is ruin the coffee.


00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.260
Processing only ruins it, you can't make it better.


00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:00.400
You can either like stabilize or ruin it.


00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.180
But you can't add value.


00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.100
So this was what producers were being told.


00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.200
And this is what a lot of roasters


00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.320
and racists and influential people still think,


00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.760
that coffee should be transparent,


00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.400
that we should just taste the terroir


00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:17.580
taste the varieties. And I really disagree with this because it's very


00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:23.160
unempowering and it's also technically incorrect. But James said this 10 years


00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:28.080
ago at this point. So I wrote to him and I said, "Do you still


00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:33.000
believe this? Do you still think that this is a fair point of view?" And he


00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.420
wrote me back in an email and he said, "It's probably a fair quote. Naturals


00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.840
have evolved but they still do paint a particular layer of flavor over any


00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.560
coffee that belongs to the processed very evidently. In rare occasions, some


00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:49.480
naturals don't taste very naturally, but that is so rare. So I think this is


00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.920
important to bring up. Again, my accompanying picture is this painting of


00:36:53.920 --> 00:37:00.480
flavor, this idea that processing is separate from coffee, that there is pure


00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.440
coffee and that processing is this thing that we're covering, that we're masking,


00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.120
that we're putting on top of the cherry.


00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.720
And I think this is a really common view,


00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.160
but I think this is very false.


00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.480
Because it's like, as a human,


00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.520
I can't separate my human cells from my bacteria cells.


00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.360
I am more bacteria than I am human.


00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.360
Separating those doesn't even make sense.


00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.880
You don't even need to do that.


00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.880
Like, we are one system.


00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:30.880
So for me, the coffee and the processing are a unit.


00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.080
It's not extrinsic.


00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:37.080
It's not external flavor that producers are painting on top.


00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:40.200
- And he doesn't mention washed coffees in there?


00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.560
- No, he really focuses on the naturals,


00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.200
I think, from the previous quote,


00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.800
but it's still this idea that flavor is on the outside,


00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.520
and that washed is a superior method


00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:54.000
because it's even less strong, like it's more clean.


00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.880
I like that's a big descriptor, it's clean.


00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.400
So washed coffees have that value of like,


00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.320
they're better because you don't taste the process.


00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.320
better because the producer is more invisible.


00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.320
You just stop it there and watch it and consume it.


00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.320
Exactly.


00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:14.320
So finally, last year, I finally got him to change his mind.


00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:20.320
So he said, so this is not being driven by consumers or producers, right?


00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:26.320
So he's realizing that this is kind of an outside-in trend.


00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.320
And he says he was anti a lot of them, adulterating coffee and not tasting the purity.


00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.320
based on impurity, he had that idea, he says "I've had my mind changed on this,"


00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.320
anything that makes a producer's copy more valuable to them is a good thing.


00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:45.320
So this has been, for somebody like him to say this, I think is a really big win for producers,


00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:50.320
because the message has still been, be transparent, be pure, you're adulterating,


00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:55.320
you're changing all of these things. And so I'm just very proud of that. Yeah.


00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:00.820
Do you have any insight or ideas onto the original quote?


00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:04.320
Like, the key thing that interests me is "I believed."


00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.320
Like, that belief.


00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.320
Where are these beliefs-- like, beyond just, like, is it just you?


00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:17.320
Is it, like, where-- besides the textbook description of saying that that was the case not that long ago,


00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:23.320
but, like, why do people just randomly believe this, like, with no evidence?


00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:26.640
or are they leaning on some false evidence?


00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.280
- I think part of it has been because


00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.680
the role of the producer has been so invisible,


00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.600
so you just don't realize how much work


00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.840
goes into transforming coffee,


00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.760
so that you think that it's just like,


00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:40.640
well, a lot of people don't think of how their coffee gets


00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.260
so that in the morning anyway,


00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.200
there's just coffee here.


00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.200
But then if they see the coffee farm,


00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.780
then you see the farm, and the farm's elevated,


00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.160
and all of the show and the barista


00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.280
and the latte art is elevated.


00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:56.000
But there's this like, big middle, like, mystery.


00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.440
And so I think it's mostly because it hasn't been visible


00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.160
and we don't know we need to care about it.


00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.840
And then we just think farm to cub.


00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.560
I mean, that's the phrasing, farm to cub.


00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:07.640
So it just goes from here to here, and that's pure.


00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.720
The best we can accomplish is this, like,


00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.160
making that distance as small as possible,


00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.280
ignoring this, like, huge middle.


00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.680
So I don't think it's necessarily on purpose.


00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.940
It's like, we don't know what we don't know.


00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.000
And so we've never seen this part,


00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.280
and why should we think that it's important?


00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.400
So I think it's part of that,


00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.680
of just, we can't see our blind spots.


00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.840
- Isn't that kind of a dangerous thing


00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.000
that happens a lot in coffee?


00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.120
It feels like a lot of times beliefs and ideas are shared


00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.560
without, as you're saying, without understanding it.


00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.920
Like, and saying things are truths


00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.320
when they're obviously not.


00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.840
- Yeah, and I have a lot of trouble with this


00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.000
because I'm trying to share things


00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.720
from a scientific perspective,


00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.720
but I still have a lot of opinions.


00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.560
So I try to be really clear, you know,


00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.860
this is a fact that has been proven


00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:58.120
by a lot of other people,


00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.960
and then this is my opinion of these things.


00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.320
'Cause I still have a lot of that,


00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.360
like my beliefs based on these things.


00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.520
So I think that's part of it too,


00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.760
is I think it's an error to think


00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.080
that science is infallible,


00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.900
and that science is also like without belief.


00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.560
Like in science, I have a lot of beliefs within science.


00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.400
So it's another system of belief.


00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.700
So I think even that way,


00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.040
it's not that there's these beliefs,


00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.380
and then there's science.


00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.580
It's just a different set of beliefs.


00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:24.420
So--


00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:25.260
- Theories.


00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.500
(laughs)


00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.340
- Yeah.


00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:33.180
So I don't think that there's like this absolute truth.


00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.580
I think that a lot of it does,


00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.860
I mean, that's why my favorite word is context.


00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:40.300
How do we talk about it within the context of this country


00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.940
or within the context of, you know,


00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.220
these people with these backgrounds


00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.940
or within the context of just this group?


00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:49.600
So I think context gives us a lot of that foundation.


00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:54.300
But I think we can get very, we're so tempting,


00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:55.700
so uncomfortable to be insecure.


00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.420
So it's so tempting to find something


00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.580
that you can grab onto and say,


00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.700
"This is truth, and I am on the right side of it."


00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.820
And it's hard to say, "I don't know."


00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:08.100
So, that's what I think.


00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.020
- That's like a human problem.


00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.780
- That's a human problem, not a copy problem.


00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.700
- It's like a society problem.


00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.460
Copy, we're just really good at it.


00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:15.960
Yeah.


00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.660
Just passionate, vocal people.


00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.940
That's a good point.


00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.860
So this slide is just to show you


00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.580
that in one gram of pulled coffee--


00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:31.060
this drawing of a hand is like maybe 15 grams.


00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.540
But in the study that they did, it


00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:36.500
was only one gram, a tiny amount, of pulled coffee.


00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:40.620
And they found almost a million different types of bacteria,


00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:45.740
200 types of yeast and 100 different fungi.


00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.880
Which is just to say that some of the way


00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.020
that we kind of talk about coffee incorrectly


00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:54.460
when we're processing is we say, that's the one with yeast,


00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.300
and then the other one's the one without yeast.


00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.900
This one has it and this one doesn't.


00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.300
We're very simplistic.


00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.540
Instead of realizing that this inoculum is coming


00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:05.620
and all of this stuff is there, all of the bacteria is there,


00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:07.140
all of the yeast is already there,


00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.420
just kind of waiting for an opportunity


00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:14.420
to expand, to reproduce, or it just sort of gets starved out.


00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:18.220
So it's all already there.


00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:21.060
So I like to say, my favorite wording is more saying


00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.060
like the inoculated one and the wild one.


00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.460
The controlled one or the uncontrolled one.


00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:30.060
We don't say yeast and no yeast, 'cause it's there.


00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.380
- So is inoculated and controlled are synonymous


00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:35.940
and wild and uncontrolled would be synonymous?


00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.060
- Not necessarily, because, so yes,


00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.620
It's sort of like a square is a rectangle,


00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.220
but a rectangle is not a square.


00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:45.180
So if we're inoculating, we're controlling it.


00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:47.780
But with the lactic, we're controlling it.


00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:49.180
We're controlling the environment


00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.220
that we didn't inoculate.


00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.220
Meaning we changed something, we're monitoring,


00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:54.260
but we didn't inoculate.


00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:58.180
So yes, inoculation is also control.


00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:01.020
But control is not always--


00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:02.340
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:03.660
But it can be inoculated.


00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:10.660
>> Yes, we could. We could. You could inoculate at any moment. You can inoculate a cherry,


00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:17.660
after pulping, you could leave it 24 hours, 48 hours, and then inoculate. Yes. You can


00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:22.660
do it at any stage. >> I... Oh, sorry.


00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:28.660
>> And then, Joey. >> I mean, what method that they can identify


00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:40.660
So many bacteria like this, it's kind of difficult to identify all of these tiny gram of coffee.


00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:46.660
No, I mean, you can, tiny gram is actually a pretty big sample in the world of biology.


00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:53.660
You can find a lot, I mean in a gram of soil, you can find even more diversity than we can find in coffee.


00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:59.660
So you mean, they use, I mean, like PCR technique or in kind of, I mean,


00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:05.660
elaborate with the technique to identify all these microbes?


00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.660
I mean, in this paper, it's just one way.


00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:12.660
I don't remember the technique that they use necessarily in this paper,


00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:16.660
but the analysis usually that I've seen is either plating.


00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:20.660
So you can take some of the sample, put it in like an auger, petri dish,


00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.460
plate it out, grow up the colonies, isolate them,


00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.780
and then get DNA of what these colonies are.


00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:27.280

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:33.280
[INAUDIBLE]


00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.260
What is the type of yeast that can have a lot of work?


00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:36.760
Yes.


00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:37.260
[INAUDIBLE]


00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.740
It has a lot of work.


00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:41.100
It's not something that just anybody can do.


00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.560
You're not going to do that with every batch of your house.


00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.060
No.


00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:44.560
OK.


00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.860
Sorry, Joey, your question?


00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.220
Oh.


00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:54.220
For natural coffees, if all of the microbial activity is on the outside of the cherry,


00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:58.720
how does that yeast inoculation process work?


00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:01.220
How would it affect the seed?


00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:07.220
It's very reduced because you have microbes on the outside, food on the inside,


00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:11.720
so it's a much more limited interaction.


00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.220
You would need some moisture.


00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:21.220
still need some moisture the way that we've submerged the coffee to have that activity.


00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:27.220
So too dry reduces that activity. So I don't have a good answer on how it happens.


00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:31.220
But it somehow penetrates the outside of the cherry?


00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:35.220
The yeast is too large to penetrate all of these tissue layers and eventually get to the seed.


00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:39.220
And that's not our goal. We don't want the yeast to get into the seed.


00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:44.420
the yeast metabolism, the metabolites that are way smaller that can actually...


00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:46.820
They always get into the seed.


00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:58.820
They can. Again, in a cherry select scenario, it's much reduced and more limited because you have all of these layers to get through to eventually get into the seed.


00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:00.820
Yeah.


00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:05.820
Julie, should we talk about your method of... like, how... you inoculate your cherries.


00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:14.820
Yeah, so I pretty much follow everything Lucia does, except I skip the pulping stage altogether,


00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:21.820
so I leave the fruit whole, and then just let the whole fruit ferment inside essentially like a tank.


00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:28.820
It pretty much depends on the altitude and all these things, there's no set time, of course,


00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:33.820
fermentation is about what's happening.


00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:38.820
But for our farm, we found that 72 hours is a really nice sweet spot.


00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:41.820
We don't go over 96 hours.


00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:47.820
We've had like poultry cherries as low as 48 hours turn out still pretty clean and nice.


00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:51.820
But basically it's a fermented natural that's submerged in water.


00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:57.820
So how can you inoculate and leave it for three days instead of just going direct to patio or direct to drying?


00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:02.820
I think it's an opportunity to reduce the amount of sugars there.


00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:09.820
And I think by reducing the sugars to fermentation, you might be also reducing your risk for contamination.


00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.820
It also speeds up germination.


00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:18.820
And so far we've found that we get a lot of pretty ester flavors that are really nice and clean, almost like a washed coffee.


00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:22.820
So it's a really nice cupping for us.


00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.820
Do you use that same yeast?


00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.820
I've been using a lot of different yeasts.


00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:33.820
But I did try wild-caught babies and they are very nice, but I have some of these that I also prefer.


00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.820
And I would think, which ones have you used?


00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:40.820
Like the 4-marina or Red Star?


00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:48.820
No, actually other Scotlabs. So the one of the coffee that I brought is called Bee Foods.


00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:55.820
Bee Foods is an IOC. But yeah, I got it through Scotlabs, so it's just another one of their offerings that was pretty wonderful.


00:48:55.820 --> 00:49:00.820
These yeasts are very specialized and pretty expensive.


00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:06.820
The way that you're using it makes me think it's more, because of the other conversation we had about the lower microbial load,


00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:20.820
you may want to have something to bring it up so that you have that decrease in substrate so that you have an easier drying time and less competition.


00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:29.460
I feel like the yeast is not able to have as strong of an impact positively as much as it's kind of giving you that insurance.


00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:34.820
It's more preventing defects, preventing issues, which kind of any cheaper yeast would do.


00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:36.820
Have you tried like red yeast?


00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.820
Yeah, I didn't like the red yeast.


00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:40.820
So they do have an impact, of course.


00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:46.820
I've tried eight different yeasts so far, and each one has a different impact on the flavor and the flavor of the cup.


00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:50.420
just keeping every single thing and just changing the yeast


00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.820
is that an act?


00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:54.220
So I think-- I don't know for sure,


00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:57.100
but I think possibly that the different yeast are actually


00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:59.300
having different flavor implications too.


00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:00.700
So maybe something is--


00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.180
[INAUDIBLE]


00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:02.680
--drastically.


00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:07.620
I could show you the cupping notes,


00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:09.740
but some are really tropical fruity.


00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.620
Others are very light.


00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:14.180
But are you finding any cups for differences?


00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:15.220
Is it mostly attributes?


00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:17.220
Yeah, cut score differences for sure.


00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:25.220
I've been doing cupping with OCR and they've been giving me results just so I'm not biased.


00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:33.220
And so they've been going from like 85-ish up to an 88, depending on the specific yeast.


00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:36.220
So going 48, I would expect.


00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.220
78.


00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:51.220
So I think the key to a process is the submerged for the time that it's in contact with yeast.


00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:55.220
Some people just put spray of the yeast on the dried cherries, which I think has much


00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:56.220
less of an impact.


00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:59.220
Again, it's more of a bio-control, so it's sort of like reserving.


00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:03.220
I have a table for 10, and I'm reserving these seats, and even though people come to the


00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:05.220
restaurant, you can't sit here.


00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:11.220
So if this yeast is dried on the surface, then it's sort of taking up that spot.


00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:17.220
And again, it's not necessarily adding, it's just not letting anybody else colonize and take over.


00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:21.220
And we've seen some of these naturals that get all the mold, they get fuzzy and white.


00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:25.220
So anywhere where there is yeast, you have the competition to have white mold.


00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:27.220
So that's very helpful.


00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:29.220
Anything about Koji?


00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:36.220
I don't work with koji, but I think that I've tried coffees that have had it and they're delicious.


00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.220
This is El Verkado, right?


00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:44.220
Yes, I think that's where it came from. Phoenix roasted it in Ohio.


00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:48.220
I don't remember who it was, but it might have been El Verkado.


00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:52.220
So I think it's a very valid method. It's obviously produced some really delicious coffee.


00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:57.220
The koji spores can be even more expensive than they used for the bacteria.


00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:00.440
So sourcing can be a bit of a limitation


00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:04.260
But if you're able to get the scores and you're able to regenerate them


00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.260
That is something that you can keep a culture much longer


00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:12.260
It's not like you have to keep buying, keep buying, keep buying. You just have to get the first starter scores.


00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:18.260
Well, they will eventually age out for a while, especially for some of the Japanese brands.


00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:22.260
Like they will start to have contamination.


00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:27.260
I mean, I feel like you could use for a season, for like your four months of harvest.


00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:31.260
Oh yeah, like it's just trying to continue on forever with it.


00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:35.260
But that's also using it the way that it's kind of traditionally used, where it's like,


00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:39.260
like the commercial sized packets can then be cut with like rice flour,


00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:49.260
and then trying to reuse that indefinitely has issues just because it's produced in facilities where they're


00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.740
Yeah, super sterile. Yeah, it's like it's just it's not


00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:59.860
As for Joseph everywhere and there are other all different kinds and so the contamination


00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:08.960
So that's yeah one of the challenges the longer you try to keep a culture the more contamination like if you're


00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:15.280
It's not diluted because it's still like a strong culture, but you're sort of diluting the purity because you have all this contamination


00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:17.280
overall of these generations


00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:23.040
That's a barrier to consistency.


00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.240
But again, with sourdough, all we want,


00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.360
we want the rise, we want the bubbles.


00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:31.040
That's an easy ask for these.


00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:34.000
But if you cut the koji, like, talk about cost-effectiveness,


00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.440
it's actually cheaper than what you showed today.


00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:41.560
For the quantity, how much needs to be evaporated


00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.960
for coffee or whatever.


00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:49.600
So I think Koji's going to be way more of an option


00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.920
for producers moving forward.


00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.540
I think there's a lot of good protocols


00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:54.580
and really good results.


00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:58.040
I just don't happen to work with it.


00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:59.200
But I-- coffees are good.


00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:06.760
So this is a study that I like to really make sure


00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.040
that really breaks that paradigm of what


00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.760
James was talking about in terms of our yeast diversity.


00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:16.500
And so when we're looking here, first of all,


00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:23.120
we have this really tiny cluster of the yeast in wine


00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.040
versus coffee versus pecan.


00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:29.240
So this was, I think, much more of a plated study,


00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.440
where they took the green coffee,


00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.960
plated it in a petri dish, and grew up the colonies,


00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.720
and they were able to identify them.


00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:39.840
Because she didn't go to origin to get fresh cherries


00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:41.560
or swab them into pieces.


00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:48.120
green coffee was just sent to her. So this was all of the yeast that survived, just the


00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:54.120
processing. So there's still a huge amount of diversity. So coffee is the one in red.


00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:58.920
So there's still a huge amount of diversity of the microbes that were found on dried green


00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:05.640
coffee that was sent. This is not fresh cherry, which is way more fascinating. There's so


00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.640
much still left over.


00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:12.020
Would that be the same as anything that's in Ben Roasts?


00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:16.080
Or is it still at a higher hydration, or fully dried,


00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.160
the same for Export?


00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:20.520
I feel like for-- because she wasn't necessarily asking


00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:21.920
for these samples for the study.


00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.040
She was just like, what samples are available?


00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:29.760
I think that they were dried to regular 11% levels for Export.


00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.000
These could just be taken and roasted and turned


00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.520
into our regular coffee.


00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.680
So that's really cool that they were


00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:40.440
able to get this much information from these samples.


00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:44.760
So the point is, the wine, the blue cluster,


00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:47.160
is very tight, which means there's


00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.640
less diversity in these wine yeasts


00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:51.800
than there are in these other products.


00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.600
But we know that there's not a lack of flavor diversity


00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.720
in wine.


00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:58.320
So I think a lot of times, producers


00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:01.200
have this fear that if I use the same yeast as many of you,


00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.640
we all start using the same yeast.


00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.920
All coffee is going to taste exactly the same,


00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.580
And it's going to lose the preciousness,


00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.800
and it's going to lose its identity.


00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:11.560
And I don't think we need to be afraid of that.


00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.060
I don't think that that's something


00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:16.380
that needs to be such a concern, because there's still


00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:17.500
so much influence.


00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.460
It's kind of giving the yeast too much credit.


00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:23.020
It's not that powerful to make coffee


00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:25.260
homogenous across the board.


00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:27.420
And even in situations with wine,


00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:29.020
where you're using the same varietal,


00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:30.780
using the same sauvignon blanc, and you're


00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:33.820
using the exact same yeast to ferment it,


00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:37.340
there's still a huge variation of flavor in Sauvignon Blancs


00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:40.220
from region to region or from year to year


00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:44.020
if you're still using the same yeast on the same variety.


00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:47.500
So, and yeast is not that powerful.


00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:50.060
You don't need to be afraid of that.


00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:51.900
- And also because in wine,


00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:56.540
when we're talking about before you sterilize, it's called?


00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:58.380
- Yeah, and you sterilize before.


00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.460
- So, probably you have more control of the yeast.


00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:01.740
- Exactly. - In coffee, no.


00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:02.880
- Exactly.


00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.120
So that contributes very much to this cluster


00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:07.240
being really tight in line.


00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.120
We're first eliminating our competition,


00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:11.000
and then we're inoculating.


00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.240
But we still have a huge variety of flavor.


00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:16.240
And in coffee, we're usually not sterilizing, even if we are--


00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.360
Could you sterilize coffee?


00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:17.860
Yes.


00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:19.840
Some people are.


00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.400
Diego sterilizes his coffee.


00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:23.200
All of them?


00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.320
All of them.


00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.840
Yes.


00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:27.080
So how do you do that?


00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.120
What is that process?


00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.120
You can sterilize in many different ways.


00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:34.840
So we've talked about using potassium metamisulfite to sterilize,


00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:37.840
you can use sulfur dioxide, you can use ozonated water.


00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:40.480
And you do that at any point in the process?


00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:44.080
Well, the sooner you do it, the more impactful it is.


00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:47.440
So if you're going to bring cherries,


00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.720
and then run it through your pulper,


00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.280
and then go in the tank, and then sterilize,


00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.080
it's sort of like a missed opportunity.


00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:54.880
Sterilize as soon as possible.


00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.320
So you're saying the cherry?


00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:57.040
Yes.


00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.040
You're going to do everything before the pulper?


00:57:59.040 --> 00:57:59.360
Yes.


00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:03.120
How do you choose what you're sterilizing with?


00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:05.480
Whatever's most available.


00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:09.560
I mean, all things being equal, my favorite method is ozone.


00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:12.720
I love ozone for cleaning equipment.


00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.320
I love-- I love ozone.


00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.160
What is ozone?


00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:20.920
It's an expensive-- can be kind of an expensive machine.


00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:23.640
But as far as I understand it, you're


00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:26.120
running water and electricity so that you can add that extra


00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:29.680
oxygen to H2O so that you have O3s,


00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:33.200
so you have that really strong--


00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.720
well, strong oxidizer.


00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.400
So you have this potential because you're


00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.600
creating this thing that doesn't really want to be connected.


00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:41.760
So that when you're applying it to organisms,


00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:44.120
that oxygen is much more available, much more


00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:51.640
likely to react and oxidize or eliminate the competition.


00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:55.400
So I like-- and then once it's kind of used up,


00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:59.080
because water-- we have a chemist here.


00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.560
[LAUGHTER]


00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:02.060
Can I explain?


00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:02.560
[INAUDIBLE]


00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:03.060
Go for it.


00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:05.560
[LAUGHTER]


00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:10.080
So it's a really nice method because it just


00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.040
dissipates into water.


00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:18.560
And so after you have that use of your microbes.


00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:21.280
But it is an expensive machine, so it's not readily


00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.060
available in lots of places.


00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.560
But if you can, I love it.


00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.560
We can just DIY that tomorrow.


00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:28.560
Get our shower heads.


00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:31.560
[LAUGHTER]


00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:33.560
Electricity is off.


00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:36.560
But I don't recommend sterilizing


00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:38.560
unless you have a problem.


00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:39.560
It can be an expensive step.


00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:41.560
It's an additional step.


00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:47.560
If your coffee's fine, don't bother with the sexual stuff


00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.560
until you have a problem.


00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:51.560
And then again, we're getting some defects.


00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:52.560
We're getting some inconsistencies.


00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:57.920
maybe start to sterilize and try that and then guess and check and then how does that work and


00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:02.160
then go back to the dry board. Maybe that wasn't the problem, maybe that wasn't it, but it's really


01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:07.760
like low-hanging fruit. It's like an easy thing to start doing after you have a problem. So in


01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.040
troubleshooting, that's not where I start.


01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:18.560
I mean, the sterilizing? How to do that? I mean, you do it.


01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:22.560
In the pulping step, or sorry, in the floating step.


01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.240
So it's something that you could put in your water.


01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.760
Oh, we also talked about salt.


01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.560
So we added salt to encourage the bacteria,


01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.120
but higher concentrations of salt


01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:33.000
are much more selective, much more sterilizing.


01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.400
So in our floating water, we could add salt to our floating.


01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.920
And so it would bring down the charge,


01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:42.320
it would help with the buoyancy to like separate also.


01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.160
It's a good idea.


01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.160
Salting your pulp.


01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.880
- And you use light?


01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.520
like infralight, something like that, infrared.


01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.520
- They do that in Hawaii.


01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.280
There's some places in Hawaii that do that.


01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.560
- Yeah, there's some places that use UV treated water


01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.040
for kind of their process,


01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.920
so to just kind of clean up their water a little bit more.


01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.360
I don't know if they're really using.


01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:05.720
And then you can wash your tanks with that water


01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:06.560
or fermentable water.


01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.360
- To connect it to the Panagoche.


01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.200
- Huh?


01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.160
- To connect it to the Panagoche.


01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.040
- Which will connect the UV?


01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.600
- Yeah, UV water.


01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:21.800
It's just that it's been processed since the cherry's been taken with a small amount of water.


01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.800
So just use this water while the cherry's still...


01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:25.800
Oh yeah, using that water while you're being...


01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.800
So yeah, that's another option too is looking at...


01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:33.800
Anytime you're adding water to cherry, whether you're floating, whether you're moving it to the pulver,


01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.800
whether you're filling up your fermentation tank,


01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:43.800
each one of those is an opportunity to potentially sterilize your coffee with one of these methods.


01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.800
And when I read Diego's protocols, he sterilizes like three times.


01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.800
[laughs]


01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.800
I...


01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:56.800
I'm trying to think if I have one of his methods


01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.800
that's so long-mixed and said that maybe we can go do together.


01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.800
But I'm not supposed to have it, so you guys can't tell on me.


01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.800
[laughs]


01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.800
You have to stop recording. Yeah.


01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.800
[laughs]


01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.800
Stop recording? I really want to know.


01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.800
Well, we'll do that. We'll do that. I'll find it.


01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.800
because it is really fascinating to see like all of the options.


01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:20.240
Yeah, because I mean the most curious thing is I think in the last years the


01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:27.440
flavors went a bit you know in intensity a bit down but still when it's fresh it's really


01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:33.600
repeatable. So for example lychee I mean last four years we have the same lychee at the beginning but


01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:38.400
it felt like four or five years ago it was like a bit more intense for a long time


01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:44.960
And nowadays it feels like, okay, and this is also feedback from a lot of roasters, like, three for one.


01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.960
It's gone.


01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.960
And you pay like three for one for a free ticket.


01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:50.960
Yeah.


01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.960
So that's pretty much...


01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.960
I'll show you the protocol and we'll go through why I think that is.


01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:00.960
I was, I'm, I'm really glad you said that because when I read the protocols I'm like,


01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.960
"These copies cannot last more than three months."


01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.960
I'm like, "I don't understand it."


01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.960
And then I asked one of the roasters, Dave Crankhouse, who bought it, and he's like,


01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.760
"No, they're lasting."


01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.040
And I was like, "You're blowing my mind.


01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.480
"I can't believe these coffees are lasting."


01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.440
So he said he was having them eight months later,


01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.280
and they were still okay.


01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.480
And I was like, "I don't know how you can accomplish that."


01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.440
- And what was the key part that makes you


01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.640
have that idea that it would not last that long?


01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.680
- I have to show you, it's three pages of processing.


01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:29.260
So I will bring it up on the screen, maybe tomorrow.


01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:31.800
Yeah, if we can get through this.


01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.920
- 'Cause you're just doing so much to the coffee


01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.400
over and over that you're degrading, essentially,


01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.840
the integrity of the seed?


01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.680
- That's what I believe.


01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:43.600
Like the process is so intensive that each time


01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.600
you're just compromising the integrity,


01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.800
- The cell-- - Like a battery ramp.


01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.120
- Yeah, the integrity of the cellular structure


01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.120
by just constantly cleaning up this coffee.


01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.880
It's getting punched in the face.


01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:57.480
- It's like a dye in your face.


01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:59.720
(laughing)


01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:04.720
- So this is, Dr. Maca, an example of a plate,


01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.280
of a peachy plate, where you just kind of like


01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:13.280
take the coffee, smash it on the plate, grow up colonies, try to isolate them, then get their DNA.


01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:23.280
So the most important finding, and again, so this is all to go back to what James was saying about,


01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:29.280
or that Paul's belief, that coffee processing is like outside of coffee, that it's extrinsic,


01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.280
that it's this additional makeup that we're putting on top of it.


01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:41.280
And for me this is really important seeing that the yeast, the microbes that are found on coffee and cacao are not crop specific.


01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:46.280
It's not about only this is found in cacao, only this is found in coffee.


01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:54.280
It has to do with the location, it has to do with the space, it has to do with Colombia cacao and Colombia coffee have similar microbes.


01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:59.280
And Mexican coffee and Mexican cacao have very similar microbes but different from each other.


01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:06.080
So it's about the place because the way that these microbes got to the place is the people.


01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.080
We carried them.


01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:10.960
We people moved from place to place and the pickers that are picking cacao, the pickers


01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:14.560
that are picking coffee, and picking papaya, and picking all of these things, we're all


01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.200
touching everything and we're carrying these microbes with them.


01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:24.040
So for me, the story of coffee flavor is not just the variety, it's the microbes that came


01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.680
with it and the people that brought those microbes.


01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.280
So for me, it's impossible to separate out and say,


01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.080
this is flavor of pure coffee, and this is processing,


01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.560
and these two things are separate.


01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:36.000
It's like they're all, I think, connected,


01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.080
which gives the producer much more of a role,


01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:42.120
much more of a place in the story of coffee,


01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:45.080
mostly which is like, seed to cup,


01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.520
and forget everything else, right?


01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:52.680
So this is kind of a reminder


01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.400
that the starting population already has,


01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:59.400
It already has everything it needs. It already has all of the yeast and bacteria.


01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:02.400
And when we change the environment, meaning we change the temperature,


01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:08.400
we add more moisture or we dry it out more, we change the pH.


01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.400
When we change the environment, we sort of open these windows, these opportunities


01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:17.400
for one microbe to dominate and for another to dominate or another one to starve out.


01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:22.400
So it's all just kind of choosing how we manipulate this environment


01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:26.560
to figure out what we want to pop, what we want to stand out.


01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:32.840
So just reinforcing that microbial flavors


01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.680
are not painted on, they're not extrinsic,


01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.880
they're not this outside thing.


01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.720
They're integral to coffee's flavor, they're very important.


01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.200
Microbes to coffee, this fermentation,


01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.520
is not this extra thing.


01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:50.580
I just wanna go a little bit further


01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:51.880
'cause I was able to go a little bit further


01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:54.320
with the Spanish group, so we're all on the same page.


01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.160
I'm just gonna do like two more slides


01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:59.560
because this really relates to why I process coffee


01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.120
the way that I do.


01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:04.320
'Cause I think about, I wanna get to my seed


01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.040
and the outside, my cascara, my peel,


01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.300
is my microbe carriers.


01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:12.240
That's where my microbes are coming in.


01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:17.240
And my mucilage, this thick layer, is my food and my fuel.


01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:20.960
But then my parchment and my silver skin are these barriers.


01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.000
So like, I want to get the microbes on the outside


01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.100
to connect with the fuel and get all the way into the seed.


01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:31.080
So for me, anything that we're doing in cherry


01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.040
is kind of starting behind the like starting line.


01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.600
It's like, I want to get here as quickly as possible


01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.680
so if I have less tissue layers,


01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.340
I can have an impact sooner.


01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:45.240
But in situations like with yusasso


01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.440
where you didn't have a pulp bar


01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.880
and you weren't able to start,


01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.680
keeping it in cherry is preserving it,


01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:58.640
is giving you much more of a buffer to be able to kind of manage time or power outages or labor


01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:04.320
shortages or something like that. So keeping it in cherry is more of a protective. So it has its


01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:12.960
purpose, but it's hard to be like protective and maximizing flavor. It's hard to do both.


01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:20.960
And we've already talked about this, about microbes change with maturity.


01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:29.680
So having the more ripe cherries, with overripe, having more of a microbial load,


01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:34.720
but actually less sugar. So one of the things that we saw today, this is a little sample.


01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.480
I mean, you brought this, right? Yeah.


01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:40.800
Mac brought this sample. So when we have all of these coffees that were white,


01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:45.600
they're kind of oxidizing and getting darker now, but we saw all of these that were white.


01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:53.360
So all of these have lost their parchment. All of these have been kind of damaged by the machine


01:08:53.360 --> 01:09:01.920
during pulping and a lot of that has to do with the overripe cherries because the overripe


01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:07.760
consumed that mucilage layer and so the mucilage layer was that protection, was that buffer, so


01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:12.720
then when it went through the machine it didn't have like its protective casing and so it was


01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:19.040
much easier to break down this parchment. It's also true that these happen a lot when it under


01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:24.960
ripes for the same reason. If you're a green coffee, you haven't developed much sweetness,


01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:29.920
you haven't developed that layer of softness, so again you don't have that protection. So in both


01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:34.160
cases the same thing happens. If you're not ripe enough, you didn't develop your mucilage layer.


01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.000
If you're too ripe, it was already eaten by something else, so when you go through the


01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.820
the machine you have a lot of damage. And so this is why I don't recommend keeping your


01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:51.900
coffee in cherry and then pulping it. So what Julie's doing, that's what I recommend. She


01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:57.060
has her cherry, she's fermenting her cherry, she's doing it in water, and then she maintains


01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:02.660
in cherry. She stays in cherry the whole time until it's time to hold the coffee and get


01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:08.820
the green out. If you do it the way most producers aren't sure, they're just copying methods,


01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:12.380
they'll do a cherry fermentation for three days, pulp the coffee, put it in the tank


01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:17.060
and do something else. So what you've done is increased the potential of these because


01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:22.420
for three days it was consuming that layer, then you run it through the pulper, you damage


01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:29.420
most of your coffee that didn't need to be damaged, and now that's a loss. And so I sort


01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:36.900
like pick a light. Like if you're gonna do it in cherry, stay in cherry. And if you're gonna pulp


01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:44.340
the coffee and do a fermentation, pulp earlier. Pulp sooner. Yeah? One interesting thing though


01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:53.380
is with Robusta, it actually is really helpful because the it's so thick and it's actually


01:10:53.380 --> 01:11:00.900
really hard to pulp Robusta fresh off the tree. But fermenting it in the cherry for a while first


01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:06.820
softens it and actually makes it a lot easier to pump. But yeah with the Rabita you're absolutely


01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:13.700
you get so many more defects. I mean we do it for some just because I feel it's worth it to


01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:21.540
get what we get from it but it's just you have to write off another five percent as defects and


01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:27.140
you're gonna do a lot of sorting. So if you have a laver or if you've tried it and you get good


01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:30.500
good results and you have a market for it. If you know this coffee has a home,


01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:35.060
then you can do it. But I see so many producers doing this blind, hoping to get


01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:39.100
a customer, and then if that customer doesn't come, they've ruined a lot of


01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:45.860
coffee and added a lot of work. And now, I mean, that's one of the like difficult


01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:50.420
parts with these processes is that they really affect the color of the parchment,


01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:57.740
Right, so we saw some of the, even in this 12-hour overnight, some of the coffees were


01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:02.980
already getting kind of pinkish, kind of orangey, and some of them were very white.


01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:06.420
So first of all, that's like a, you know that these two are different.


01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:10.940
These are not homogenous coffee seeds.


01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:15.460
And because in these countries the tradition is more commercial coffee, you just produce


01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:19.540
coffee, you sell it to the co-op, and you move on.


01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.580
And they can't cup the coffees.


01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.140
They don't know what they taste like.


01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:25.020
So visual cues are really important.


01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:27.820
So if the coffee looks a certain way,


01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:29.740
they think it probably tastes a certain way,


01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:31.420
and they'll give you a certain price.


01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:33.580
But I have heard so many sad stories from producers


01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:35.460
who tried an anaerobic fermentation,


01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:37.500
who tried a carbonic maceration.


01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.180
It stained their parchment.


01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.260
The flavor was probably great.


01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:44.040
It might've been an 86, but no one's cupping that coffee.


01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:44.900
So it looks stained.


01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:47.900
So they had to sell it as pasilla, as segunda,


01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:52.300
as like lower inferior quality, as like 79 point coffee,


01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.540
because no one's gonna take the time to taste it.


01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:57.600
And because it looks visually worse.


01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:01.220
So when I was working,


01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:05.380
I did a project with TechnoServe like 2015,


01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.040
and we did this yeast,


01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:10.420
and this yeast process with the SEMA,


01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:13.820
and the TechnoServe guys were so pumped.


01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:16.660
They loved the process, and they haven't even tasted it.


01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:19.500
Like we've just done like a 36 hour fermentation,


01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:22.280
but because the parchment came out so white,


01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.660
they called it huesos, like bones.


01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:27.200
It was so bone white that they were just like,


01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:28.620
we can just sell this on looks.


01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:30.900
We don't even have to, this can not taste any different,


01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:33.140
but because it's so pretty,


01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:34.660
we can sell this coffee for more.


01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:36.320
And that was enough for them.


01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.860
So it's one of those like double-edged swords


01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:42.180
where if you have the market


01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:45.520
and we already have the buyers, that's great,


01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:48.520
But it's very risky to go in that direction,


01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:49.920
change the color of your parchment,


01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.360
and then maybe not have a place to sell it.


01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.720
So that can be really tough.


01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:57.840
The last point.


01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.280
- I'm going by because I have a question here.


01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:06.240
So you say in the cherry we have the--


01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:07.280
- The yeast and the bacteria.


01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.560
- Yeah, the bacteria.


01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:11.880
But when with the pulp, so we mainly take it out.


01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:16.880
when the bacteria or the yeast pass through the mossy.


01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.560
- Well, not necessarily,


01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.480
because if you saw the way the pulper works,


01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.440
so it's like this hopper,


01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.440
and the cherries are rolling around in it,


01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.840
and as they're rolling around,


01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:26.200
they're contaminating,


01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.240
they're depositing their microbes on the surface.


01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:29.080
- By any way you remove.


01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:30.680
- And then your cold coffee's going through there too.


01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:34.320
So your cold coffee is still getting like bathed in it.


01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.920
So it's lower, it's a lower charge


01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:38.440
'cause you don't have all the cascara,


01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.640
but you don't have like a perfect separation.


01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:44.040
you're still getting that mixture.


01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:48.200
So there's still a lot of microbes in my pulped coffee,


01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.060
even if I take the cascara away.


01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:53.260
They're still there.


01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:58.080
This is just to go back to the idea of the tablets.


01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:01.080
I was also mentioning, if you don't want to make a tablet,


01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.400
just do it by weight.


01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.000
100 grams of coffee, separate out by color,


01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.600
and then weigh the dark ones and the green ones.


01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.000
It's another easier way.


01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.240
The tablet just is fun.


01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.240
It looks pretty.


01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.240
Yeah, it looks pretty.


01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.240
It makes good pictures.


01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:20.240
But you could also just do it with a scale and you just grab a cup, 100 grams, and do


01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:21.240
that exercise.


01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:29.240
So no excuses, no excuses to not do your screening.


01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:38.240
So this is another study I really like because it talks a little bit about my concern with


01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:43.120
so much of what's happening in specialty is that we talk about the infrastructure.


01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:48.560
So we think that a natural tastes like a natural because I put it on a raised bed


01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:53.280
and a wash tastes like a wash because it's in a tank and we think there's something magical about


01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:57.840
the equipment and it's happening a lot with carbonic laceration. There's something special


01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:03.200
about the tank. If I get this stainless steel tank with these valves like this tank is the


01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:08.720
thing that's going to give my coffee the flavor. It's the tank, it's the beds, it's the the


01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:15.520
containers. But it's not about the containers, it's about the microbes that are found in those


01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:24.560
environments. So this is a study that they did, uh 2006? 2008. And they took a dry process coffee,


01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:31.200
so a natural coffee, from zero to 22 days on raised beds, and every couple of days they were


01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:38.200
we're doing this DNA ID of what are the microbes that are found on the surface of this product.


01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:43.960
And in the first four days, they saw that, okay, so here in this graph, what we have


01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:49.800
is the pH is going down. As the pH goes down, our moisture also goes down. That's water


01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:55.840
activity. Water activity, moisture content, it's going down. And days are on the x-axis.


01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:01.120
As more time passes, it gets more acidic and more dry.


01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.120
We know this.


01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:03.120
We know coffee.


01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.120
That's why we do it.


01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:08.080
We dry it so that the moisture will go down over time and as there's more contact, there's


01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.080
more acidity.


01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:15.200
So what they found is that in the beginning, in the first four days, 96% of the microbes


01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:16.200
were bacteria.


01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:19.560
It was dominated by bacteria.


01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:25.080
But as time was passing, as it was getting more acidic and less moisture, it flipped


01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:28.080
And then it was dominated by yeast.


01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:31.440
Because yeast have, again, a more developed cell wall,


01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.640
each generation, they get a little stronger,


01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:35.880
a little tougher, they adapt better


01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:38.760
to the more harsh conditions.


01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.600
More acid is harsher.


01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:43.280
Less moisture is a difficult condition


01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:44.880
if they want more moisture.


01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.680
So the yeast can survive.


01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:48.400
So the yeast survived.


01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.960
If you look at the 22 days, 11% moisture,


01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:55.340
they still found several species of yeast that were present.


01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:57.680
This is why Amy Dudley in Washington


01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:05.200
in that previous study was able to find all of this diversity


01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.320
in coffee.


01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.960
Because even at 11%, even dried coffee,


01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:11.520
there was still all of this range of yeast.


01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.760
At that point, the bacteria that needed the moisture,


01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.160
there wasn't that much bacteria that they could find.


01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:21.400
So yeast is, again, a more robust, bigger target.


01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:26.400
So what's interesting about this, what this tells us


01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:29.920
is that a natural tastes like a natural,


01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.840
not because it's on a raised bed,


01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.740
but because it's a yeast dominated process


01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:38.080
and it's this particular, these particular species of yeast


01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.800
that are dominating the process.


01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.360
So if we can take these yeasts and put them in a tank,


01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:48.760
then instead of spending 22 days to get a natural profile,


01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:51.280
we can maybe do it in 36 hours.


01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:55.600
And the benefit of that is, as a producer in these countries,


01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.960
a lot can go wrong in 22 days.


01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.360
You can lose power, your workers don't show up,


01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:04.280
no one's ready to make the coffee, you get a storm in,


01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.120
the currency is incredibly devalued,


01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.200
so now you can't buy the things


01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.160
that you thought you were gonna value.


01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.400
A lot can happen in a month.


01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:13.960
And to get that flavor profile in less time,


01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:17.160
because we know what microbes are creating this flavor,


01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:19.880
that gives a producer a lot of flexibility,


01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:27.080
lot more options. And so this is the idea of making a washed coffee taste like a natural,


01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:30.600
but what Julie was telling us was the opposite. She's doing a natural because for her it's


01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:36.440
important to not use as much water, so to be conserving, and also there's a lot of labor


01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:41.640
involved in washed coffees and equipment. You have to have a pulper, you have to have a tape,


01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:46.280
you have to have somebody doing all this stuff. So for her a natural, a dry process, is less effort,


01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:52.440
less flavor and less water, more in line with her philosophy, but she doesn't want the natural


01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:57.880
traditional flavor profile. So she puts it in water, she increases that moisture so that it's


01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:06.920
dominated by other microbes, and she's inoculating, so she gets a washed profile from a natural coffee.


01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:13.720
So the problem with so much of specialty is that we're looking at the gear to give us the flavor


01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:18.760
and completely ignoring the microbes that are actually giving us the flavor.


01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:27.320
Why is doing the fermentation


01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:31.240
with the choice drying?


01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:40.280
Because they can live with the oxygen and also without the oxygen.


01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:44.440
So, with the environment with the oxygen,


01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:48.200
why they're doing the imitation, I'm just wondering.


01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.720
- We will get there, there's a whole section on oxygen.


01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.920
'Cause the other question was anaerobic.


01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.800
And is it still an, you're asking, right?


01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:58.040
Is it still an anaerobic if I'm opening and mixing?


01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.880
If I'm mixing my tank all the time,


01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:01.800
can I still call that an anaerobic?


01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.520
There's a whole section on that coming up.


01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:07.960
- And also it's related, like, you always hear like,


01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:12.240
36 hours, 72 hours, it's pretty much the same concept


01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.720
that you have.


01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:18.720
It has to do, it's related with the embryo of the coffee


01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:22.800
or why, like worldwide you always have those times,


01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:23.640
you know?


01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:27.800
- I, my experience is because that's just the worker times.


01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.200
So it's either, like the units, it's one day


01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:33.280
or one day and a half, or when people are available.


01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:36.320
So there's nothing magical about 36 hours,


01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.440
It's just a day and a half.


01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:42.280
So the cherry comes in at night, usually,


01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.840
and then we wait one night,


01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.480
and then we process in the morning.


01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:49.420
So it has more to do with the cycles of the sun


01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:52.440
and when people are working than the optimal time.


01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.560
The optimal time could actually be 17 hours,


01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.080
but that's four in the morning and no one's gonna work,


01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.440
so it doesn't matter.


01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:03.120
We still have to wait for 7 a.m. when everybody shows up.


01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:06.040
So it has to do with the practicalities


01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:12.360
when people can work. Okay because others say like you go up to 72 hours the embryo of the coffee is


01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:22.760
gonna die or something like that. Not necessarily. I don't, the embryo has a lot more influence like


01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:27.320
with temperature so I could have a really long fermentation but if it's a lower temperature and


01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:34.360
I'm able to preserve that embryo it's fine so it doesn't it's not time time is too short. And it's


01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.040
- It's no lack of oxygen either.


01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:36.880
- No.


01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.000
- It's just temperature.


01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.700
- No, it can be...


01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:46.140
Lily, do you know what causes embryonic death?


01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:50.560
- I've seen a lot of anaerobic, or not a lot,


01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:53.840
I've seen some anaerobic happening, embryonic death.


01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:55.160
I know that in kickout,


01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:57.400
it's caused by the heat during the fermentation.


01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:58.840
- Like that one?


01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.840
- Right, in kickout, you want it to die.


01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:03.720
- But in coffee, no.


01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:06.880
Preferably not, yeah.


01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:07.380
Preferably no.


01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:08.840
How do you measure it with the--


01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.800
with the-- sorry.


01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:14.240
Viability-- you can measure it with an electrical signal,


01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.600
where you just see if you can run it


01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:19.640
through the machine that gives you some percentage.


01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:21.920
But the easier way, if you're not in the lab,


01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:24.160
is you just plant them and you see, do they germinate?


01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.040
So if my embryon's alive, it will germinate.


01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:27.360
And if it never--


01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.840
so then you can get a percentage.


01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:33.440
I put out 100 seeds, and five of them germinated.


01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:37.600
question do you plant it in a pergamino?


01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:40.560
right? i try just growing some seeds from it


01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:42.560
you can't? oh you wanted to grow some seeds?


01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:45.520
in pergamino yes. i was gonna say like a


01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:49.680
maybe it's the amount of time that it spends with the acid


01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:53.440
if it's a really acidic environment like if you're doing like a really long


01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:56.080
permit and it's getting really really acidic


01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:59.360
and it's sitting in the acidic for a long time maybe that's going to be


01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:02.720
not very long? i think that's a good point so it's it's many things it could


01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:06.800
either be the lack of oxygen, it could be the really high acidity, it could be the time. So


01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:12.720
you can't just say 72 hours kills an embryo. No. Okay, why cacao you need, like it's better


01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:18.400
to have the embryo, actually you need to have the embryo die and not in coffee, you know? Because my


01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:24.240
understanding is like when it dies you start to release certainties in the cells that is going


01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:31.000
gonna affect your flavor right? I don't know.


01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:38.160
I think I've never thought about why we want it, an idea of why we want it to die.


01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:42.160
I think germinated cacao tastes too bitter.


01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.160
Yeah, it's like poor quality.


01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:46.160
Like it's an actual defect.


01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.160
If it's germinated, you throw it out.


01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:52.160
So I was told that it's because it's poor quality


01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.460
like in plant products, but in coffee,


01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:57.260
it's just such a different world,


01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:59.360
that I'm not really sure like,


01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.800
what I'd bring.


01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.560
- Yeah, I don't know either.


01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:07.360
- Chef's degree, or does it, longevity of chef life?


01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:10.660
- Well, the more aliveness you have,


01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:12.360
the more, the higher percentage,


01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:15.920
the longer your chef life, like in coffee.


01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:19.920
- Isn't, like, thinking about it cut down,


01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:22.640
doesn't necessarily need that same chocolate, right?


01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:25.400
Isn't it processed a lot faster since it can be stored longer?


01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.400
It's processed a lot faster.


01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:31.800
And going back to the original point where we eat--


01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:33.520
let's see, we eat that thing.


01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:34.840
We have the cacao.


01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:40.040
With coffee, it's more processing, more steps.


01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:40.540
So--


01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:42.720
So you're eating a chocolate-covered espresso.


01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:44.880
Unless you're eating a chocolate-covered espresso.


01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:45.380
Yeah.


01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:58.740
So going back to the tablet a little bit, if you're going to do a natural process,


01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:00.580
this uniformity is really important.


01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:07.500
You really want your coffee to be highly selected and all red if you're going to do a natural


01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:09.420
process, if you're going to do dry.


01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:10.420
If we're doing our tank, less important.


01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:12.420
less important.


01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:15.420
So this is the way that I think of it is that


01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:22.620
we had coffee cherries and we saw all the different colors. We saw the skittle. So we know that the red ones are probably


01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:29.400
around 55 moisture content. This is how much water is in the fruit. And the ones that are green


01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.400
maybe they have a little bit more because


01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:39.340
they're just these green seeds. The ones that are overripe, the ones, these like raisins, are obviously going to have less moisture content.


01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:46.780
So you have all of these cherries starting out at the different internal moisture, but we want them all to get to 11%


01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:49.220
We want everything to be at this end point


01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:54.060
So it's like you're starting a race and everybody's starting in a different position


01:26:54.060 --> 01:27:00.380
So the time that it takes you to get from 25% to 11 or 58 to 11


01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:07.680
It's a different amount of time. It's a different fermentation. So we think of like one batch of process


01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:14.480
but each each fruit is a bioreactor. Each fruit is its own little fermentation in isolation.


01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:19.920
Each one is doing its own thing. So in this case you have a lot of cup to cup variation


01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:27.120
when you're not sorting like this. When you don't start with a really even ripeness. So Julie,


01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:33.200
you must spend a lot of time sorting. That must be one of your bigger expenses? Not too bad,


01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:37.040
but that's because we're a highly trained crew of like three people.


01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.040
So you're picking well.


01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.040
Yeah, so we're picking very well.


01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.040
So yeah.


01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:43.040
So that's the goal, leave it in the field.


01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.040
Exactly.


01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:48.040
Don't bring it and then have to kind of go through all this stuff.


01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.040
So this creates a lot of variation.


01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:54.040
If you're starting at a different point and you're all going to the same place,


01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:57.040
all getting there at different times.


01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:01.040
The contrast and why I like to work with washed coffees


01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:05.180
is because we take all of these different moisture levels


01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:08.440
and we pulp them, we remove the outer layer,


01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:12.080
we submerge them, and then we can kind of standardize them.


01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:14.900
The ones that are drier can take up a little bit of moisture,


01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:17.440
maybe the ones that are too high can sort of equilibrate,


01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:21.200
and we can get a much more uniform starting mass.


01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.760
So now instead of all starting at different points,


01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:25.280
we can all start at the same point


01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:26.760
and we move as a group together.


01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:30.000
We all move towards the 11%.


01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.760
So this is why I have a higher tolerance in the wash coffees


01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:39.120
of how much I'm allowing to go into my tank.


01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.920
That's why I'm not so picky.


01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:43.680
If I was making a natural, I would be super picky.


01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:46.560
- Unless you submerge it in water, or even then.


01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:48.920
- Well, even then, I mean, that helps a lot,


01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:52.520
but even then you still have even more layers.


01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:54.960
So, you know, she's submerging for three days,


01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:59.640
so maybe it takes them 72 hours for that water to permeate.


01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:01.640
and get more of that evenness.


01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:04.640
I think that really helps for that reason as well.


01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:07.640
But again, I'm just looking at that.


01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:10.640
Do you have any visuals in terms of like, um,


01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:16.640
what to use in, like, 23% of the universe is flat?


01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:19.640
Do you base your work on that?


01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:21.640
I haven't done that study, I don't know.


01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:23.640
This is like my idea.


01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:25.640
This is like a representation of what I think is happening


01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:27.640
and why I do it this way.


01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:31.120
Do you think you can test it and it'll help?


01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.600
Like, if you--


01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.240
How would I test that?


01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:41.560
So the problem is most moisture meters don't test above 30.


01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:44.640
So I could potentially do it by weight,


01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:46.840
like how much it's weighing and seeing how much it's


01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:48.600
losing over time.


01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.480
But no, I haven't done it.


01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:51.880
But I think you could with weight.


01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.520
Moisture meter would be too hard.


01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.680
But you could try that experiment, see how much.


01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:59.320
So like, yes, what's the tolerance?


01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:00.440
What's the threshold?


01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.520
How do we know that one that's as low as 23


01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:04.440
can actually kind of go back up?


01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:08.080
I haven't done experiments,


01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:09.400
so I don't know that I can do that,


01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:12.000
but we've seen that coffee's incredibly,


01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.640
high-gross, not fake, we want it,


01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.360
when we soak it, especially green coffee,


01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.460
we can bring the moisture up very readily.


01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:27.480
So this is, you know, you know Dima.


01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:28.560
- Well, I already know him.


01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:29.480
- You know of Dima.


01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:32.120
So I was in--


01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:33.320
- School of life.


01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.720
- School of life.


01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.400
I was in Africa at the same time as him.


01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:37.520
We didn't plan it.


01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:40.040
We just happened to be there at the same time


01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:42.120
in Rwanda, visiting the same person.


01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:47.120
So I spent, I spent like 20 days with him.


01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:51.600
- That was enough to get the feeling, right?


01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:52.840
- He is very, yeah.


01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:55.440
Like, when you think of crazy Russian, he is like...


01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:56.280
- Super crazy.


01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:57.120
- Super crazy.


01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:57.940
(laughs)


01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:01.580
- Yeah, I've never met anyone more crazy than him.


01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:03.280
- I have a picture I can show you.


01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.920
No, yeah, he was very, he's very nice,


01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:06.680
but he's very much a crazy Russian.


01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:11.280
So, this was his version, a natural.


01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:15.560
So he had all of these cherries on these raised beds,


01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.320
but you can see they all have moisture.


01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:20.120
So he was trying to accomplish this like funkiness


01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:23.600
by having a natural coffee in the cherry


01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:27.120
act more like a wash, keeping the moisture up.


01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:29.640
So he called these sanchichas, which are like hot dogs.


01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:30.920
That was the word.


01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:33.880
So you have these plastic bags, so you


01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:37.920
have a low moisture content in these raised beds.


01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:40.420
So it's a similar thing to what Julie's trying to accomplish


01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:43.400
with increasing the moisture but keeping it in cherry


01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:47.560
and not getting a traditional natural profile.


01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:50.560
So these are just creative ways that you can...


01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:55.560
But the whole thing was also that he used black plastic just before...


01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:59.560
This is something to do with a UV that did not...


01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:04.560
Because he had it once in Rwanda, he asked to buy black one,


01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:06.560
and they were like, "There's no black, we want green."


01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:07.560
Yeah.


01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:10.560
And it all went a bit wrong because...


01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:15.560
This I just don't remember because we're not really like out giving the...


01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:22.120
But this is something to do with the like, that UV is something, and with the black you prevent it.


01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:30.840
So with like yellow, green, you just have this interaction from the sun with your fermentation


01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:35.240
process. So it's either, I don't know, maybe it speeds it up or it's just something that has...


01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:42.360
That doesn't make sense to me. Like, if he thinks it's color related because it's UV related,


01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:49.640
that that's a hard sell. Meaning that for me the color I do believe that it influences but I think


01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:54.840
the color would have more to do with like the temperature so that black got hotter and potentially


01:32:54.840 --> 01:33:02.680
killed off most of the microbes so he had like a very mild or whatever like result that he was


01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:07.720
looking for so less defects or less of the thing that he didn't want whereas another color didn't


01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:09.800
and get it taught and get it accomplished,


01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:10.640
that kill step.


01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:14.240
Because, again, if you want,


01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:17.600
like, yeah, UV and coffee is not very well studied


01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:19.320
and there's not a lot of information


01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:21.560
and most of it, like, I just,


01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.160
I don't know if you've seen any.


01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:25.240
(laughs)


01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:28.400
So whatever he was doing was just like,


01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.360
he saw something, he had a feeling,


01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:32.160
and then he's like trying to explain it


01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:34.960
with his own observations and not from any study,


01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.840
like, not science that I've seen.


01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:40.840
But then there is just the water. It's basically a tank but on a bed.


01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:43.840
Yeah, basically a tank on a bed.


01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:47.840
And for how long can it do this? Like three days?


01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:49.840
Yeah, like three days.


01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:55.840
But then how are you going to get rid of the water?


01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:00.840
You just pull the plastic out and then it just stays like a natural.


01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:02.840
Yeah, you just kind of pull it out.


01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:04.840
So yeah, pretty simple.


01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:11.840
And I think, well, and some of the things that we talked about, some of the, well, so this was even with the black plastic.


01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:18.840
So, I mean, I, for me, I was like, that doesn't make me want to try it.


01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:23.840
Like, sitting in a cupboard and mold. But he was happy with the result. That's what he was looking for.


01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.840
So, the beauty is in the eye of the beholder.


01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:30.840
I mean, it looks, when you look at the green, it's not green anymore.


01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:36.400
It looks like really brown. Basically it's like a mix of the sour cherries, would you say?


01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:42.520
But and yeah, I find that I mean he describes it all the coffees really


01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:48.760
Diversely, but at the end and he's making it right now all over like Costa Rica, Colombia, Ethiopia


01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:51.780
For me, it's personally tastes a bit more or less the same


01:34:51.780 --> 01:35:00.500
So people love it, people buying it and this is the whole thing and he's just like producing it a lot of right now


01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:06.500
but personally, we just get to the point that it all like got to some point


01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:10.500
a bit all fermented, a bit vinegarish flavor to me.


01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:12.500
So, personally, I...


01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.500
I think that we talked about this in the Spanish session too,


01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:20.500
that, okay, so I'm making this argument that processing isn't going to mask your coffee.


01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:24.500
It's not going to make everything taste the same inherently.


01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:27.500
But it's not that it can ever do that because that's an example of it.


01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:32.380
example of it. When you have something that is so strong and so like


01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:37.420
intentional, yes you can get to the point what you're saying is that he's doing


01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:40.580
this process on all these coffees from all over the world and they're really


01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:44.580
the same. They're really you know evening out and that same thing was said in the


01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:49.100
other group of another process. Like an aerobic for example. Yeah it's so strong it's like


01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:52.540
okay one from Costa Rica tastes the same as one from Peru tastes the same as one from


01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:55.540
So why am I bothering?


01:35:55.540 --> 01:36:04.540
So I think that's dangerous because the whole point of processing is it was giving the producer an opportunity to become empowered.


01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:08.540
To say, "I have a voice. I have a place in coffee production."


01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:17.540
Because the traditional method is commodity, meaning I'm just going to get whatever's cheaper because I'm just going to roast it, whatever, and sort of move on.


01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:19.940
And then we had this opportunity for producers


01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.540
to have a site, to have a place,


01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:23.540
and think about processing.


01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:26.540
And now the processing is so strong


01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:28.820
that we're reverting back to,


01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:31.980
it doesn't matter where this process is coming from,


01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:33.500
so I'll just buy the cheapest one.


01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:35.260
If coffee's cheaper from Costa Rica right now,


01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:36.980
I'll get that anaerobic from Costa Rica


01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:39.940
instead of that anaerobic from Kenya or whatever.


01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:40.780
Kenya's a bad example,


01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:42.260
'cause I don't do that much experimental process,


01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:44.500
but you get the idea.


01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:47.400
So it's like, it's kind of come full circle.


01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:52.280
Like, coffee producers were in the struggle of being lost in commodity,


01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:55.000
and then they've kind of been able to have this voice.


01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.480
And now it's just going back, reverting to--


01:36:58.480 --> 01:36:59.280
Where's coffee?


01:36:59.280 --> 01:36:59.780
No!


01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.760
[LAUGHTER]


01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:04.720
And now we're reverting to, oh, OK, all these processes taste the same,


01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:08.800
so I'll just get the cheapest one, which is not the point of differentiating


01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.040
your coffee.


01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:14.560
Do you think there's any way to actually fight against that


01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:16.160
in our current climate?


01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:18.760
or is that just kind of like the cycle of


01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:23.040
like the people who have like power influence


01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:25.280
to say at the consuming end,


01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:27.040
will kind of always cycle back and be like,


01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:28.400
oh, we liked that you did this,


01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:30.080
now we want to control this thing.


01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:33.360
- I mean, for me, the way to fight it is like that,


01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:34.720
like you're literally fighting a wave,


01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:35.840
like you're fighting the ocean


01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:37.160
and it just doesn't make any sense.


01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:38.320
Like trends are gonna be trends,


01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:39.880
and they're gonna die and they're gonna come back.


01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:40.720
We're gonna have bell bottoms,


01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:41.540
we're gonna have skinny jeans,


01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:42.380
we're gonna have bell bottoms,


01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:43.200
we're gonna have skinny jeans.


01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:45.720
You're not gonna like escape that cycle.


01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:48.960
So the way that I think you actually can fight it


01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:50.500
is by not participating.


01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:51.340
So most people are like,


01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:54.080
"Oh, I'm gonna fight it by being ahead of the curve."


01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:56.600
I'm like, "I just don't play."


01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:58.720
Just don't play, and then you don't have to fight it,


01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:00.000
and then you don't have to be behind it


01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.880
or figure out where you are with it.


01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:04.920
So that's why I try to work with producers to say,


01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:08.280
"Don't figure out how you can make your coffee more crazy,


01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:09.680
"'cause then you're always fighting yourself.


01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:12.380
"You always have to talk yourself next time.


01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:14.300
"Figure out how to make your natural profile


01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:20.820
36 hours instead of 22 days and then like go on a vacation or have time with your family or like get a hobby


01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:22.900
Like do something else


01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:24.900
Instead of spending more time


01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:26.900
like hiding in this like


01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:28.900
really difficult


01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:31.820
market. And they came up in the Spanish group as well


01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:36.700
Don Marco gave an example of a producer who did this very complicated process


01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:41.300
The copy did really well, he got 90 points and then he's like next year


01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:47.620
I'm gonna do more and he like pushed harder like double down and the coffee was actually came back in


01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:52.020
87 which is still a really good coffee but it's like look you had just kept doing what you were


01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:58.740
doing I figured out how to replicate your 90 and done the same you'd be ahead of more effort more


01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:03.780
expense and a less less of a return now your coffee is a little bit lower so there's this


01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:08.500
like delicate line where you want like I want producers to innovate I want them to be creative


01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:12.060
But I'm seeing so many of them shoot themselves in the foot.


01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:14.060
They're trying too hard.


01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:19.060
I think there are always gonna be some who just, like, want to do it for shits and giggles,


01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:25.060
because it's fun, but not for--I think you're advocating--that's not the game for everybody.


01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:30.060
Yeah, like, figuring out--like, for me, one of those people is Enrique Lopez and Pikachu,


01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:35.060
and then, like, I've been to his spot twice, I've stayed in his house, like, I love this guy,


01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:40.060
And I know that his experimentation comes from his soul needs to do this.


01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:43.060
And he is such a beautiful unicorn. I love him.


01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:46.060
But then so many producers see that and they're like, "I need to be like that."


01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:51.060
And I'm like, "If it's not coming from your heart, this is a tough road to travel."


01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:57.060
And he's so effortless in his experimentation and his creativity.


01:39:57.060 --> 01:39:58.060
Where's that from?


01:39:58.060 --> 01:40:01.060
Enrique Lopez, Pinta Chilin.


01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:02.060
In what?


01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:03.060
In Oaxaca.


01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:10.060
And then we had to actually take him to the room and then they said we can reveal his


01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:11.060
body.


01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:12.060
So yeah.


01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:13.060
But that's like the unicorn, not the wolf.


01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:14.060
And so many producers think they have to get there and they feel that like, "Oh, I'm being


01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:15.060
left behind."


01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:16.060
Like artists think they need to be Picasso or Dali or, you know, whomever, but like,


01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:17.060
just paint what you want to paint.


01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:18.060
And the part where he's like, "I'm going to be a wolf."


01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:19.060
And then he's like, "I'm going to be a wolf."


01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:20.060
And then he's like, "I'm going to be a wolf."


01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:21.060
And then he's like, "I'm going to be a wolf."


01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:22.060
And then he's like, "I'm going to be a wolf."


01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:23.060
And then he's like, "I'm going to be a wolf."


01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:24.940
"Oh, I'm being left behind."


01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:27.980
- Like artists think they need to be Picasso or Dali


01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:30.620
or, you know, whomever, but like,


01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:32.140
just paint what you wanna paint.


01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:36.100
- And the part that's not talked about as much


01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:38.980
is that most buyers, most consumers are like,


01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:39.900
"I just want a wash.


01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:41.820
"I just want like a clean washed coffee."


01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:44.740
And a lot of the conversations on our Discord channel


01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:47.500
have been other exporters in like in Australia,


01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:48.780
and it's like, "My wash is like the thing


01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:50.620
"that sells out the fastest."


01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:52.860
It's like, "I have all these experimental coffees,


01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:54.860
what people are asking for in my lives.


01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:56.860
But this is, I think it really depends on


01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:58.860
when you're


01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:00.860
when you're starting to buy for the


01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:02.860
specialty, because I mean


01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:04.860
I could see like comparing like


01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:06.860
for example Russian market and European market


01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:08.860
like Russian market


01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:10.860
you know already like, you know a couple of years ago


01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:12.860
everybody was like, okay we are done with it


01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:14.860
we just want to get back to bush


01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:16.860
and then European people are still like, yeah


01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:18.860
Jesus, I really like this fermented


01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:20.860
stuff, and you're like


01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:22.860
It's such a 2020.


01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:24.860
It's so 2020.


01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:31.860
And, like in the United States that had a little bit more of a developed market, a lot of that was like, "Oh, that's so 2018."


01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:43.860
So, depending exactly on where you are in your market's maturity, and what I think that shows, so right now Asia, Dubai, Korea, that's who really wants these copies.


01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:46.300
And so all of these producers are scrambling to make them.


01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:47.900
And I'm like, OK, history has shown us


01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:50.220
that everyone's going to get tired of those coffees real


01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:51.060
fast.


01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:52.940
The wave has already passed everyone else.


01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:55.220
So now you're selling to Korea.


01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:56.700
And then they're going to get bored


01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:58.180
and want these washed coffees again.


01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:00.540
And then you're going to be like, who wants some coffee?


01:42:00.540 --> 01:42:01.420
But people are still--


01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:04.380
I mean, not in many people, but mainly producers and exporters,


01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:08.460
they're trying to just jump in this train that's already


01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:09.460
sort of like leaving.


01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:10.740
The train is already-- yeah.


01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:13.220
But because-- especially in Ethiopia,


01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:19.000
I just mean in December and like there's a really nice exporter who was like selling for years


01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:27.680
Beautiful clean washed and natural coffees and then like last table. It's all I know a little bit fermented stuff and we like it's a gross


01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:32.160
You just don't want to drink it at all. She's like I love it


01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:37.500
I mean, I don't know it's like sincere saying that she loves it. But of course everybody's like, okay


01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:39.500
This is we sell to the Asia and Dubai


01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:45.860
So they still sort of like people still buying there, but we are all questioning like for how long


01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:50.820
Because like I think it feels like one two years and then it's gonna be


01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:58.640
I think a lot of competition coffee


01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:07.060
Mostly comes from Colombia with some kind of fancy


01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:14.060
I mean, the process and the price is so high.


01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:19.060
And in Thailand, we also are very crazy about this kind of coffee.


01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:25.060
But I mean, if that influences the coffee producers here to do the same stuff?


01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:26.060
I think that's two things.


01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:29.060
So the question from Kanatha is like, well, what's next?


01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:34.060
And so we're kind of like passing through most of the consuming countries.


01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:39.900
countries. So what's next is producing countries, producing countries that have a growing consumer


01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:48.540
base. So Mexico and so the newbies, all of the new people in producing countries,


01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:52.380
they're going to be able to ride that wave. So at some point it's getting recycled


01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:59.660
in that sense. So I think that's going to be, because it's such a gateway, it's such an


01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:07.740
entry point into specialty coffee that that's where I see it going. But again, I think it's


01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:11.820
a really hard road because it's like you're making something that's about to go out of fashion and


01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:20.060
you're just hoping. Lizard. Oh, lizard? There's a big lizard here. Like, oh no, that's another


01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:26.700
lizard. I guess I need to go on now. Does it scream? I haven't heard it. You know that one?


01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:29.660
- I think that's something that's--


01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:31.920
(laughing)


01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:36.900
- So that's, we're gonna stop there for today.


01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:40.020
A lot more questions and then we have dinner in an hour.


01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:45.580
Oh yeah, sorry, we're measuring.


01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:47.020
No, don't go, stay here.


01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:49.220
We're gonna go measure our fermentation tank.


01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:53.300
So let's grab the Spanish group and we'll meet at the tank.


01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:55.500
We need to make some things for our daddies.
