00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.520
We still have activity and we're protected.


00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.420
So if this has been completely flat and no bubbles


00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.780
and just completely on the surface,


00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.520
I would be concerned that we're starting


00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.260
to get some spoilers.


00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.100
(speaking in foreign language)


00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.340
activity of the bubbles, but at least here in the plastic it is still


00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.300
generating enough gas to raise this bubble and that gives me confidence that my


00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.020
coffee is protected, which is the same fermentation that is continuing. If it were


00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.100
totally flat, without activity, that's where I'm going to worry that there is


00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.020
opportunity for defects, for decomposition, which is not a desirable


00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:00.020
The one that was in the plastic bag, the one that was desirable, but my bacteria died and something happened.


00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.020
So that's a very good sign of activity and protection.


00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:28.020
So what I want to check on, the water is pretty cold.


00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.220
And now my coffee is a lot cleaner, meaning the mucilage has fallen off.


00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.820
So now this feels on Friday like my yeast felt on Wednesday.


00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:51.820
So yeah, if you guys want to stick your hand in here and feel, first of all, the temperature.


00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.820
It's cold.


00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.820
Yes, it's cold.


00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:09.820
But now the parchment is clean, but it's Friday and it's at the same level as the yeast that started on Tuesday, no, Wednesday.


00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.820
At the temperature level?


00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.820
No, no, no, the level of how it starts.


00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.820
The temperature?


00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.820
Yes, the temperature.


00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.820
It's a smaller fermentation process,


00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.820
so it's moving more slowly.


00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.820
So this is the path until now,


00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.820
it's always clean, like in yeast.


00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.820
Ah, ok.


00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.820
Compared to yeast.


00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.820
Is it just because of that, or why do you think it's the same?


00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.820
Um, one, it's the same thing.


00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.820
So it's because of the fermentation,


00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.820
because of the curvature, because it's smaller.


00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.420
- But I mean, it's only because it's smaller,


00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.760
so it's shorter.


00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.920
(students chattering)


00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.960
- So, I think it's like half and half here.


00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.660
Maybe like 60% it's lower because it's smaller,


00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.660
but in the other line, we added a line that was dominant.


00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.780
And this one, you get it.


00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.620
- That's cool.


00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.780
- Yeah, so part of it is the density.


00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.540
Part of it is the concentration.


00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.880
- So it gets smaller.


00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.060
- Yeah, yeah.


00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.460
If I use these, I'll make it smaller.


00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.660
- It's interesting.


00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.160
Because that's one of the problems with doing theory.


00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.000
- Do a trial.


00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.820
- You have to do a trial.

I think if you wanted to do an experiment to see what would taste better, you could take this


00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.160
batch and wash half of it, cut it like


00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.800
wash half of it today at 4.5 and then leave it until

leave the rest of the batch until it's pH 4

We have our pH is 4.5, so we know we still have more distance to go.


00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.820
Our mucilage is off, so again, I could wash it, I could not.

There's no correct time to end your fermentation.

So the bricks in this one pretty much were the same all the time.


00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:14.420
Because our lactic bacteria are not as interested in our glucose the way our yeast are.


00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.420
So if you have a fermentation that is just like the bricks never ever changes,


00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:24.420
it could be an indication that it may be more bacteria dominated


00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.420
and the bacteria are using some other organic acid versus the yeast really like the sugar.


00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.420
So the yeast will deplete the sugar.


00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:38.420
But in that case, we are not sure how much of whatever they like is still there.


00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.420
Yes, that's correct.

[inaudible]


00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.820
Yes, it is more flexible and more available to measure, but since it didn't change much,


00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.220
it started at 4.5 and at the end we went to 4.


00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:22.220
So it didn't change much, but we can see that the activity that is predominant is not the yeast,


00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.220
because the yeast likes to eat sugar, but we would call that bacteria.


00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.420
So since bacteria are not very interested in sugar, they prefer protein.


00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.820
So that's why we can see that it's not changing.


00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.020

So this was at 22 right now.


00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.420
And we really want to keep it at 25.


00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.920

And not let it get cold at night and then warm up during the day and get cold at night.

If you have a way to insulate it or to put it in a warm bath, that would be...


00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.920
So this is more sensitive to temperature than yeast?


00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.920
Yes.


00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:51.920
Yes.


00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.920
The lactic is a lot more sensitive to temperature than our yeast fermentation.

But like 20 is just normal.


00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.920
Well I mean we saw here at night it was going down to 22, 21.


00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.920

Whereas the lactic, you really do want to be


00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.460
more on top of the temperature.


00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.740
- It's easier to keep this in smaller batches, say?


00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.020
- Well, yes and no, because the bigger batches

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.660
- Like without any of those things,


00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.280
it's not really providing enough information.


00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.200
- Right, and it could actually be misleading information.


00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.440
So like for example, in the farm that we went to


00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.080
with Roberto, where they do the 200 hour cherry contact,


00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.800
200 hours is extreme, it's a long time,


00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.880
but because it carried her being kept so cool,


00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.320
there was not a lot of influence,


00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.600
there was not a lot of activity.


00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.880
They were just pushing pause for 200 hours


00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.020
just to be able to add 200 hours to the label.


00:14:55.020 --> 00:15:01.600
And then here, conversely, this is Monday to Friday,


00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.680
this is another long treatment,


00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.120
but the effect in the cup is going to be very minimal


00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.520
what we're just looking for is like clean, bright acidity. We just happen to do it in


00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:18.920
a less expensive way. Salt is less expensive than yeast. And maybe again, this would be


00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.120
an option if as a producer you didn't have enough space or maybe it was like kind of


00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:33.320
cold and so you wanted to extend your processing for, what's the word, like for efficiency


00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.920
I just don't have enough space on the patio, so I'm going to do a longer fermentation in


00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.320
my tank until the space is unoccupied, but it's not going to make the coffee more extreme.


00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.320
I'm actually going to have a mild effect.


00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.320
So it's like different levers you can pull.


00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.320
Anichka, did you have a question?


00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.320
No, I wanted to ask you a question.


00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.320
Oh, I thought you were raising your hand.


00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.320
Gracias.


00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:13.320
So yeah, putting number of hours on a coffee label is really misleading in some cases or unnecessary or just not very helpful.


00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:23.320
And sometimes they are not really accurate. You know, they say 36 hours, but they didn't every time say 36 hours. It's like, oh, it's 36 hours.


00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:28.720
And so for the yeast, I would say it's a 36-hour yeast fermentation,


00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:34.420
but we also had 24 hours in the cherry on the truck, like waiting before we started that time.


00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:39.040
So it's my 24 hours plus my 36, which ended up being 45.


00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.880
Right, like by the time we actually washed it.


00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:47.200
And then as the coffee is still this moist, until the moisture goes down,


00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.900
there's still some activity here, depending on how thoroughly we cleaned it.


00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:56.900
[ Inaudible ]


00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.660
>> And it's me or it has less whites?


00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.800
It's more clear.


00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.360
The other one has more.


00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.500
In each batch, we have more whites.


00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:18.900
[ Inaudible ]


00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:27.920
I don't feel comfortable saying completely, but really really close.


00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.920
Really really close.


00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.920
As close as you can get to like a clean slate.


00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.920
Yeah, this one seems just nicer.


00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.920
Because I remember each batch of the other one was full of whites.


00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:46.920
Well, so that would be interesting because it could just be, this is a smaller batch


00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:54.920
so you don't see... percentage wise it could still be the same, it could still be 5%.


00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:02.920
It's also darker right here, like we're not in full sun. I wonder if it were so, so sunny, we could see the difference better?


00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:08.920
Or the other one is more rough with the process. I mean, the beans lose more density or something.


00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.920
I think they're both similarly gentle.


00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:22.320
I wonder if it's a matter of our perception because we're in like in the shadow and so it's harder to see


00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.480
like high contrast


00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.800
But if it were full if we were in full sun and it wasn't cloudy


00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:38.320
Angela's question is she feels like this this badge has fewer of the white has fewer of these


00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:44.480
So she's asking if one process is more gentle or more rough than the other one. I don't think so


00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:49.760
I think Cat's point is it's also more shadow here so it's harder to see the


00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.080
contrast to see how many of these white ones we have and I think percentage-wise


00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.640
it could still be really similar.


00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.200
How much?


00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:04.000
Or we just got lucky with this batch?


00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Natural variation.


00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
A chance.


00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Yeah because this one was two buckets.


00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Yeah.


00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.600
Each bucket that we received of the other one was full of


00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.200
white, we were cleaning a lot.


00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.840
This one is pretty much clean.


00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.920
- But it could be also the case that


00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.320
when we were like just cleaning the parchment,


00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.120
we did like something really properly


00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.440
and it went straight away to be black.


00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.960
Because there is also less cherries.


00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.960
So, in the last we were dumping in the black bucket.


00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.960
So this is like just...


00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.960
- The skin is lower.


00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.960
- Since the beginning.


00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.960
- Yeah, remember there's no skins here.


00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.960
- Yeah.


00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.960
- No tiny skins.


00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:57.960
- I also noticed yesterday the first kama had the most skins


00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.960
and then it had less and less as we went


00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.960
because we were taking from the top


00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.960
and then as we went there were less and less to put out.


00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.960
- Interesante.


00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.760
Okay, kiosk time.


00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.600

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.120

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.680
Start packing, yeah, you can start packing.


00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.760
Taking your pictures.
