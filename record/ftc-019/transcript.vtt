And we can definitely dry.

We do have a cap now, so before, so what's happened is, also if you felt it, it's much easier to move.


00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.260
It's much more liquidy.


00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.260
There's this much liquid on top.

Yes, we have like a cap now.


00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.660
So before the volume has gone down, right? So before everything had this like


00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.860
cushion of mucilage around it. When the mucilage breaks down, the coffee sinks.


00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.180
So we have this gap. The seeds got smaller. So we can, and so all of this


00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.020
stuff that's floating, you can tell it's coffee that's very either empty,


00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.260

so there would be a lot of those

and then it'd be like either low quality

so taking it out as a cherry you get you get a lot of things you don't want here but then


00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.700
there's also some of these that the cherry would sink but then once you get it free it from the

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:31.860
- No, same.


00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:37.260
- So the VH would be kind of a slower and then--


00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.100
- Like how low?


00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:45.100
4.9 and it gets 5.1.


00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.100
It goes up?


00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:46.600
Yes.


00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.100
And then after another two hours, it goes down again.


00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.100
So we were wondering why is it.


00:15:53.100 --> 00:16:00.100
And we thought it's because of the liquid or fluid.


00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.100
It could be that it's--


00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.100
this is a mixed solid for me.


00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:09.100
It's really difficult to measure one unit


00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.620
and you have a lot of liquid in the beginning,


00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.060
you still have all of the mucilage all around.


00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.580
So you're gonna have a lot of variation.


00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.740
Like this one is still very sticky.


00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.040
It still has like a, all this like ooey.


00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:32.060
So as it's dissolving, it's changing the liquid.


00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.300
So it could be that in the beginning you're measuring,


00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.540
depending on where your probe hits,


00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.020
maybe your probe is just hitting a coffee bean,


00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.580
and then you're just getting that part.


00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.740
And then as time goes on,


00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.640
you get more of the liquid more mixing.


00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.720
So then it goes down.


00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.060
But that's very strange.


00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.100
That's very strange.


00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.300
- It's like submerged.


00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.300
(people chattering)


00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:59.780
- I've never seen that.


00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.900
If you send me pictures of it, next time it happens.


00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.380
- And my other question is that in this tank,


00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:16.380
When we were cleaning up, we wanted the water to be a little higher over the top of the coffee.


00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:24.380
And then at the beginning, now when we open it, you take out the filters and all the ingredients you want in.


00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.380
And so the beans sit on them.


00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.380
Yeah.


00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.380
And now they are back at the same height.


00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.380
Once you mix it up, they are all set.


00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.380
Salt and vinegar came back up.


00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.380
The question is why?


00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:44.380
If you think of it in terms of salt and vinegar chips, yeah, it's not bad.


00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:51.380
Just to cover the top, I just want it to be right on top and then we use the plastic to keep it down.


00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.380
Just for concentration.


00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:57.380
If you want to put a little bit more because it's easier to skim off the top, that's okay too.


00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.380
It's not bad.


00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.380
And if you would add more water, it would be great.


00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:10.380
Just a dilution, which could be fine, but I try to have it as concentrated as possible.


00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.380
And another question, sorry.


00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:17.380
The sima yeast, how do you separate it in this, like the concentration?


00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:24.380
By the dosage. We know that when we're adding it in that amount, that's why we don't underdose, to be stretching it.


00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.380
And the temperature as well?


00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:30.380
The temperature is less important because this yeast is very robust.


00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:36.380
This yeast can do much lower temperatures, warmer, it's a very strong range.


00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.380
So it has less to do with temperature and more to do with just the dosage that we add in the beginning.


00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.380
Okay.


00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.380
Thank you.


00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.380
Did we get the brief here?


00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.380
I forgot my question.


00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.380
You were talking about the muesli.


00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.380
Oh yeah.


00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:55.380
I mean, the muesli is gone but we're still going to keep fermenting it because


00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:00.380
Because what's the point of fermentation? If your point is that muesli is gone, yes you're done.


00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.380
But we're going to keep going because we want to develop more flavor.


00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.380
Yeah.


00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.380
What kind of flavor do you want?


00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:16.380
I think maybe a place for contact time. Maybe the flavor can come into the seed a little bit more.


00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.380
More contact time.


00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.380
Yeah.


00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:24.380
And what about measuring? How would you optimize your process to measure the flavor?


00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.380
I just do it with food.


00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.380
So we have breakfast, we check the coffee before lunch and dinner.


00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.380
So you can just do the three times.


00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.380
And then you can just do the three times.


00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.380
And then you can just do the three times.


00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.380
And then you can just do the three times.


00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.380
And then you can just do the three times.


00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.380
And then you can just do the three times.


00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.380
And then you can just do the three times.


00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.380
And then you can just do the three times.


00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.380
And then you can just do the three times.


00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.380
And then you can just do the three times.


00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.380
And then you can just do the three times.


00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.380
And then you can just do the three times.


00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:39.380
And then you can just do the three times.


00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.380
And then you can just do the three times.


00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.380
And then you can just do the three times.


00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.380
And then you can just do the three times.


00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.880
after four hours and it's full.


00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.380
But is there any such a strict rule?


00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.880
I just do it with food.


00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.880
So we have breakfast, we check the coffee


00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.380
before lunch and dinner.


00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.380
I just do the three times that I remember.


00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.380
It's part of the day.


00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.380
Yeah, okay.


00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.380
Thank you.


00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:04.380
Alright, Sebas, we're putting the number.


00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.380
How many for the work?


00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.380
1.3


00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.380
1.3, okay.


00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.380
Wow, so it's more than our big guess.


00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.380
Yeah, it is.


00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:25.080
Yeah, so because we want the contact. It's like marinating. We want our meat to marinate in the stew of flavors.


00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:32.620
Okay now...


00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:46.500
But Spanish group and grupo español de Piosco, English group has like another hour to hang out before we switch.


00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.500
And then we're going to cut the coffees.


00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.500
Okay.


00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.500
Alright?


00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.500
¿Qué hora y hora?


00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.500
¿Huh?


00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.500
¿Qué hora y hora?


00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.500
Uh-huh.
