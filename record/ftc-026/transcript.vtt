00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.500
I think there's a few more that we can take out now.


00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.500
The last one at the store, it's a landscape over there.


00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.500
So a little bit of work here was a long way.


00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.420
(speaking in foreign language)


00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.340

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.340
(I don't think there's any more water, it's from up there)

>> Lack of nutrition or I mean?


00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.340
>> Many reasons.


00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:34.900
reasons. It's lack of nutrition, it's insect damage, it's genetic, yeah like


00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.700
aborted, yeah like the embryo aborted, like there's a lot of different.


00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:51.700
And the fermentation, I mean, why make it like, because I mean, it survived the first day, it didn't float, but float now?


00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.540
It was just trapped underneath. It's not that it became worse. It was just like


00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.940
trapped under the other ones. And then every time we mix it we can liberate it.


00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:12.820
So two things that you can do is in this way we use one dose of grease


00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.420
and we're able to do this fermentation. If you do it a little bit shorter, like 36 hours,


00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.140
Then I would collect it, like siphon it off,


00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.140
and then add it to your next batch of coffee.


00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.140
And then here, what they're doing is they're going to wash it


00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.140
and they just add it to the water.


00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.140
Because again, you don't have anything to do with it.


00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.140
So if you have more coffee coming,


00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.140
you can use it for the next batch and then fill it with water


00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.140
and wash it and then it's all good.


00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.300

[ Inaudible ]


00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.300
Because then, even though it has little by little,


00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.800
when you add it to your fresh coffee,


00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.800
it's like refeeding it.


00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.960
(chatter)


00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.300
But I wouldn't use it more than three days,


00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.800
three batches, just so that I can use it


00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.460
for my fresh coffee.

- Is it something you've experienced?
