(inaudible)


00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.820
Not yet. Right now we're at six.


00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.420
So you've been saying that under -- everything under one.


00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:44.920
So technically for production purposes, for like making a


00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.920
we consider anything under 2 anaerobic.


00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:55.920
Right, so the air was at 20, and this is at 5.8 and dropping.


00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.920
So there's a lot less oxygen, even though it's open,


00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.920
even though it's never been sealed and never been closed,


00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.920
and we mixed it vigorously to get our measurement,


00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.920
we're still pretty anaerobic.


00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.920
We're at 5.6 and dropping.


00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.920
Like, it's still taking a slow measurement.


00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:19.920
What you can consider anaerobic is the low tube.


00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:30.920
And how does that, microbial processes going on, there's a lot of anaerobic mutation happening, but the entire...


00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.920
So we're going to talk about that too, because there's three different layers.


00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:42.920
layers. There's the fermentation, the metabolism of fermentation is an anaerobic process. We


00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.920
don't use oxygen as an electron donor. Then you have the environment. So even if your


00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:54.920
fermentation is anaerobic, the conditions that it's in, so is it on a raised bed, completely


00:16:54.920 --> 00:17:01.920
exposed to oxygen, or is it submerged underwater? So the environment can be either more, that's


00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.920
So that's why I like to differentiate between anoxic and oxygen filled.


00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.920
So, because we're talking about different things.


00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.920
Then the third layer is your microbes.


00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.920
So even if your fermentation is anaerobic by definition,


00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:21.920
and you are in an aerobic environment, like in a natural process, there's lots of air,


00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:27.920
then you still have the microbe, whether it's metabolism, it prefers oxygen, or it doesn't.


00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.920
The problem is we collapse it all into "Oh, is it anaerobic?"


00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.920
And it's like, "Well, what are you talking about?"


00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.920
Are you talking about the metabolism? Are you talking about the environment?


00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.920
Or are you talking about the identity of the microbe that's doing the action?


00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.920
So there's three different layers.


00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:46.920
And not that you need to know them, but it's just like, again, we kind of throw out these terms.


00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.920
And they are very...


00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.920
Okay, we're now at 4.8.


00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.920
So we're getting very close to an anaerobic.


00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.920
even if it's completely open.


00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.920
So, yeah.


00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.920
Do you have a question?


00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:03.920
Yeah.


00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.920
So, usually when we say anaerobic fermentation,


00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.920
we're just trying to communicate how it is.


00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.920
Usually.


00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.920
So, what would be different if I, like,


00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.920
immobilized bubblers in a fish tank?


00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.920
Like, I just threw a bunch of those in there,


00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.840
picked it up to pure oxygen and just...


00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.840
What would that change? So it would change... it's sort of like


00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.280
we put salt in here so that we selected for some


00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:41.080
and suppress others. So if you add a lot of oxygen


00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.400
that way, like a stone, like they do, they aerate rain tanks, they aerate


00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.640
beer tanks or a fish tank, then you're selecting for some


00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.080
and suppressing others. So it's the same as adding salt here.


00:18:53.080 --> 00:19:00.080
So we'll talk more about oxygen later.


00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.080
Tomorrow.


00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:10.080
And this might be a silly question, but there's liquid here, so I would assume H2O, like when


00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:18.080
we're talking about oxygen going away, is it being taken out of H2O?


00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.080
Like I don't know how to ask that.


00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:25.080
What is this measuring and what is the issue?


00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.880
So we have dissolved oxygen in our air,


00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.920
which we know is about 20%.


00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.880
Most of air is actually nitrogen, not oxygen.


00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.920
So oxygen, that's what we saw was our 20%.


00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.400
But then you have dissolved oxygen in water.


00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.640
So we can measure our water.


00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.160
And when I've measured the water here, it's about like a nine.


00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.120
Like just water has less oxygen than our air,


00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.640
but it's still pretty high.


00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.600
So here, we're having this fermentation.


00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.760
All of these bubbles are producing carbon dioxide,


00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.480
so it's displacing the available oxygen.


00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.480
There's still going to be H2O bound together.


00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.360
That's not available.


00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:08.360
But the oxygen that is liberated is being displaced


00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.640
with the carbon dioxide, so that's how you get this lowering.


00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.420
It's not like water's disappearing.


00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.840
Especially, I mean, it could evaporate off.


00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.920
At some level, if we leave this open,


00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.760
it is going to evaporate out.


00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.400
So it's not necessarily disappearing.


00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.640
It's like what you can measure and what's found.


00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.880
What's available and what is...


00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.720
We might get closer, 3.9.


00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:39.400
But we can also cover (speaking in foreign language)


00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:44.800
So I'm going to leave this here and let's...


00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.720

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.720
[Spanish]


00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:57.720
So that's not measuring oxygen that's part of other molecules, it's just measuring free oxygen.


00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.720
Dissolve free oxygen.


00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:04.720
So we'll see what it is after dinner.


00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:21.720
So the point of this is to show that anaerobic, Angela is...


00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.720
Bullshit.


00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.720
Keep in mind.


00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:30.720
So anaerobic here, like even, it doesn't have to do with like the show of the CLK.


00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:37.720
Like when you have this fermentation and you have this bubble, the fermentation itself is creating, displacing oxygen and becoming...


00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.720
Anaerobic.


00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.720
And becoming anaerobic.


00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.720
Without you, you don't have to do anything.


00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.720
You don't have to purge with nitrogen gas.


00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:50.720
I've seen some producers put in a candle inside of a barrel to consume the oxygen.


00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:57.720
I don't love that method, but it makes sense to put a candle inside of a coffee, a lit candle.


00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:06.720
So you can do all of these things, like buy a tank of CO2 and purge the container to get that anaerobic,


00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.720
or you do nothing and you get there anyway.


00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.720
It's done.


00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.720
That's what happens.


00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:17.720
[ Inaudible ]


00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.720
>> It's because of the activity of the microbes.


00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.320
So they consume the oxygen and produce carbon, right?


00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.720
>> And actually with submerge,


00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.220
you would actually have more dissolved oxygen.


00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.720
The water has H2O, dissolved oxygen in your water.


00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.720
So if you had it dry, we didn't submerge it,


00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.720
but at least covered it, and you had some activity,


00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:47.720
then the gas, the CO2 is still displacing and you might be able to get anaerobic faster than submerged with underwater.


00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:56.720
So pretty close, we're 3.3. And that's again, opening it up and mixing it.


00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:03.720
The fermentation is so active and so strong that all the CO2 is just creating an anaerobic environment anyway, on its own.


00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:13.720
So this is not true of like every single fermentation ever, just this yeast is very vigorous and it's very active.


00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.640

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.560

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:53.960
Will it dissolve the oxygen?


00:23:53.960 --> 00:24:01.960
With a lot of air, or if we leave it distilled or with water in it, it has less oxygen and less humidity.


00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.960
So, it depends.


00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.960
What's the pH of water?


00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.960
Two stuff.


00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:23.960
So if we had had another tank that would be done exactly the same way and had seals that are completely tight, just based on the ethanol,


00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:29.960
or ethanolic, or whatever, at the end would the predictability be any different at all?


00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.960
Not really.


00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:38.960
For me, with this yeast, because it's so vigorous and it acts so quickly, with this yeast and that method, I don't see a difference.


00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:45.960
It could be something like this, like again, this is much slower, we're not seeing as much activity, so there could be a difference.


00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:50.960
So that's kind of my point with a lot of producers, it's like you could do all that effort, or you could not.


00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.960
But it's not really doing anything.


00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.960
And you could just get to the same point anyway. Yeah.


00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.960
So a lot of the times it's like, oh, but I have to justify myself to the buyer, I have to show them all the work that I'm doing.


00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.960
But at the end of the day, in the cup, it's very minimal influence.


00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.960
I just don't want producers to struggle so much, but you don't have to struggle.


00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:22.960
It's going to stay like this. We're probably going to wash it Thursday morning.


00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:34.960
It's more like the flow, because tomorrow we have the cupping, so we're not going to wash it.


00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.840
and then we're gonna go to the farm.


00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.320
We're not gonna be sitting here washing a tent.


00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.400
I wanna wash it in the morning.


00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.400
So Thursday morning is just like,


00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.200
it's like a personnel, like putting humans first.


00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.720
I never put the fermentation first.


00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.880
I was like, when is the most convenient time


00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.960
that I feel like it?


00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:56.200
No, especially with this yeast,


00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.180
that's why I like it, have this buffer.


00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.640
So if I do 32 hours of 40,


00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.600
I'm gonna get really similar results.


00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.760
But on something that's unknown, something like this,


00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.680
32 or 40 hours, I'm really different.


00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.520
So I like to use a SEMA because it gives me this buffer


00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.640
that I don't have to like rush and wash my coffee.


00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.800
Yeah, exactly.


00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.960
It's not gonna like run away from me.


00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.800
- Does that expand to the 300 or 500


00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.260
or other permutations as well?


00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:29.640
Like, do you have that same kind of flexibility?


00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.800
- Well, I wouldn't do that long of a permutation


00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.280
with this yeast.


00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.280
So what happens if that's happening?


00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.880
Who uses this as a go-to?


00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.920
- I don't do those.


00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.640
I don't do those if I can help it.


00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.040
So yeah, I don't do a 300-hour fermentation


00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.240
'cause I don't see the point and I don't see the benefit.


00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.520
If I can get, I'm not saying it's not better,


00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.000
but it's like I can do a 36-hour fermentation


00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.320
and get 85, 86-point coffee,


00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:01.320
or a 300-hour fermentation and get an 85.5-point coffee.


00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.600
Like it's just not, it's so much more time


00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.480
and it's diminishing returns.


00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.440
So for me, I'm like, if I can get 80% of the way there,


00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.320
like I'm good, let's move on.


00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:17.280
No, that's a good point.


00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.320
I still take my pH into consideration.


00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.840
I'm still checking it.


00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.720
I'm still seeing that it hasn't stalled.


00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.560
I'm seeing that it hasn't like, caught up.


00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.120
- It usually goes down, right?


00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.240
- Usually goes down.


00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.240
But in some moments it just stops.


00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.240
Sometimes it can stall.


00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.240
[laughter]


00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.240
I don't know until I've tasted the coffee.


00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.240
So sometimes a stall doesn't have an impact,


00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.240
and sometimes a stall is a problem.


00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.240
So I can't tell.


00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.240
The only thing I can tell is if it goes back up.


00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.240
That is definitely a problem,


00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.240
and usually it's because the meter is uncalibrated.


00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:58.240
It's very, very weird and difficult for it to just go back up in pH.


00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.240
The pH will trend down or it will stall.


00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.240
But is there like a window that you aim for?


00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.240
I try to stay above 3, pH 3.


00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:15.240
But I usually don't have to like, with this yeast, that's kind of my protection, that's my insurance.


00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.240
It's like driving with your seatbelt on.


00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.240
This is just, it's less risky.


00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:24.240
But at the same time, because the yeast is acting more time.


00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:30.640
time. More time would mean more of certain components I guess so the flavor will change


00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:36.000
each day let's say. But so this is a live


00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:46.160
like a live process so the microbes are alive so the yeast are producing more of a certain component


00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:51.840
so it's getting more food I'm sorry it's eating more of the sugar and creating more of the acids


00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.240
but there's other things in here that will eat those acids.


00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.240
So it's not that the more time you have,


00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.240
the more and more and more and more and more.


00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.040
So now something else could come and eat that,


00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.840
and then you could be having less and less and less and less and less,


00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.540
the more time you go.


00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:08.540
So more time doesn't correlate one-to-one


00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.840
to having more intensity or more flavor.


00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:16.040
It could be that you're breaking that down.


00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.040
Something else can eat it.


00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.340
[inaudible]


00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:26.500
You can sterilize it and then it depends on the rest of your process because again every time I'm putting my hands in there,


00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:32.200
every time I'm mixing, every time I'm not sterilizing this, when I'm putting it in, I'm always introducing more.


00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:36.180
So sterilizing once is not enough when we're


00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.180
constantly touching the top of it.


00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:43.680
So there's the paddle, there's this plastic, you put this plastic on the ground, we rinsed it,


00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.680
and we just sterilize the plastic and put the plastic back.


00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.680
Does that make sense?


00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.180
Where are we?


00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.680
2.4?


00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.180
Let's see how this one is.


00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.180
I think this is kind of stabilized at 2.4.


00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.680
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:15.180
Is that what you were watching as the stabilization


00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.180
of the measurements?


00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.680
Or was it literally--


00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:22.680
I think initially it was like down to below air.


00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.680
It was stabilized.


00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.680
And then the dropping, I think it was actually dropping because it was breathing.


00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.680
It was actually producing more CO2 and dropping.


00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.680
We're getting real time measurement of it dropping.

Hey! Yeah, Dan Arovik.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.680
Not necessarily.


00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.680
But it is a good sign.


00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.680
Now, this would mean that, speaking in terms of oxygen,


00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.680
not being anaerobic, we would have said that...


00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.680
It cannot happen.


00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:58.680
Acetic acid cannot be given without oxygen.


00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.680
I remember that in one of the podcasts you said that in the case of levatures,


00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.680
acetic acid can be given, but not as a primary result, but as a secondary one.
