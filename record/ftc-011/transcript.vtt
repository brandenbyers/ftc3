We're going to figure it out right now.


00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.560

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.320
But what I wanted to tell you is, so in your data sheets,


00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.880
we're tracking these things.


00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.320
So if you go to Clevadura Lacos, your yeast,


00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.800
my lady has already started to fill out what we're doing.


00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.720
And so here, in [SPANISH] the time that we inoculated


00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.200
is right now, 10.30.


00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.240
We added the yeast now.


00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.160
So a lot of people think right now, 10.30,


00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.640
is the start of fermentation.


00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.920
And they say, my fermentation is 36 hours, or whatever.


00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.960
But if you look at our sheet, we know


00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.080
that we started pulping at 6, 7 in the morning.


00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.080
So we've had another extra four hours of like a natural fermentation.


00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.080
Wild.


00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.080
And then the coffee came in yesterday.


00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.080
So this coffee has already had 24 hours of a wild fermentation.


00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.080
And now we're starting a second one.


00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.080
So a lot of people start their time at the tank, but the time started at the truck.


00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.080
My coffee's been active since my truck.


00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.080

So that's like your artistic side to say,


00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.840
is it a double fermentation?


00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.420
Is it a triple fermentation?


00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.420

So the question was, we did the citric with lemon juice, and could we just use citric acid?


00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.900
So yes, and then the question is how much? I don't know. We're going to find out.

Let's put it in here.


00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.900
But I don't know how much to use. So now I have normal water to...


00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.900
So you're going to add until it reaches 2.


00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.900

And the ratio, how would it always be?


00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.900
No, it's just to cover.


00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.900
Another container with another shape, if it's like thinner, maybe I need less liquid to fill.

(speaking in foreign language)


00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.700
So that's not a ratio that I want you to memorize,

like kilos of cold coffee to citric juice.


00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.380
It's just enough citric juice to cover it.


00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.660
So if this had a different shape,


00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.140
I would need different amount of liquid to cover my coffee.


00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.180
No specific volume, it's just an eye measurement


00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.720
of how much liquid does it cover.


00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.000
And in that one we don't measure the time, right?


00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
We're going to measure it right now.


00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.120
We're doing like too many things at once.


00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.440
So this is just water and we're just adding citric acid.


00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.280
Okay, now we dropped to three.


00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.360
So we were at six.


00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.360

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.360
And you want two.


00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.360
I want at least two.

So you don't know if they're friends.


00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.360
It also depends on the water.


00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.360
It depends what my starting water is.


00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.360
So if the water is too hot, I'm going to add a little bit of water.


00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.360
And then I'm going to add a little bit of citric acid.


00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.360
And then I'm going to add a little bit of citric acid.


00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.360
And then I'm going to add a little bit of citric acid.


00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.360
And then I'm going to add a little bit of citric acid.


00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.080
what my starting water is. So if the pH of my water is more basic, I need more citric acid.


00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.640
So I can't tell you always do two grams per liter because it depends on my water.


00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.240
What I want to do is my pH.


00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:09.920
Well, so there's two things we could do. We can decide as a group. If I want to match the juice


00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.680
of the lemon, I stop at two. If I want a faster reaction, maybe I go lower. Maybe I go 1.5.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:08.540
So if we took these fermentations to the end, if we just were going off the pH, we would say


00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.660
they're the same. But if we take another measurement, well they're actually very different,

The change of this with the previous liquid is only water.

So it must be lower because it is liquid.

Of course, not the prix, but the pH.

Yes.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.240
Because that's all I've been taught since day one, that beware of overfermenting.


00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.240
Yes, that's...


00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.240
Horrid vinegars and...


00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.240
Well, it's just a bad way to name it.


00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.240
Yeah.


00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:17.240
We'll talk about it. I remember my first call to you was, "How do I prevent overfermenting?"


00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.080
- Yes.


00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:18.920
- Yes.


00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.740
(speaking in foreign language)


00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.460
- But I mean, the citric acid,


00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:25.140
can it come out into the bean or the--


00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.560
- Eventually, eventually,


00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.380
but we're doing this for less than one hour.


00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.740
So there should not be any influence


00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:35.460
of the citric on the coffee, all the way to the last.


00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.860
- But if you put it for--


00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:40.780
(speaking in foreign language)


00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.700
(speaking in foreign language)


00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:51.700
because the lunch was ready, so we started eating and then we washed it later.


00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:57.700
So to make the point clearer, I want to do it with less time to decide.


00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.700
- Because we have to take out the...


00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:05.700
- Yes, because some people said when they tried the coffee, "No, the coffee has other citrics."


00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.700
And I said, "How? It's only six hours."


00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:12.700
Nothing, no contact, so that the big one comes in.


00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:19.700
[Spanish]


00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.620
(speaking in foreign language)


00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:27.540
(speaking in foreign language)


00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:31.460
(speaking in foreign language)


00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:35.460
We're going to wash it as soon as we can.


00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:39.460
And then where are we going to wash this?


00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.460
We're going to wash it and also...


00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:46.460
So Sebas, this is almost ready to be washed.


00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.460
So if you can, put it in the sink.


00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.460
And dry it.


00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:56.460
We're going to take the data from the yeast.


00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.460
That too, but we have to prepare the lactic.


00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.460
We need one more.


00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:04.380
(speaking in foreign language)


00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:19.680
Keep working until it's--


00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.680
- Is there any danger of over rubbing them?


00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.520
- No.


00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.360
(laughing)


00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.400
- I said I was afraid of that.


00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.960
- No, you cannot over rub them.


00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.160
So could you use a washing--


00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.920
a washing--


00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.420
A washboard?


00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.220
A washboard, yeah.


00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:34.720
You could.


00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.680
[INAUDIBLE]


00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.720
I think you could also just leave this more time.


00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.160
If we left this for like an hour and a half,


00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.440
it would just dissolve on its own.


00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.960
So in the last workshop, I left it for six hours.


00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.200
And that's what the coffee you're going to taste tomorrow.


00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.720
And a lot of people were saying, oh, I taste the citric now.


00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.520
And I'm like, no you don't.


00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.440
It was only six hours.


00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.180
Like, it's just kind of like in your head.


00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.960
Like, six hours is very little time.


00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.080
So to make the point more clear, I'm going to be like,


00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.800
okay, this is 40 minutes.


00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.560
You're not tasting the citric acid


00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.240
in 40 minutes of this plus all the other.


00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.360
So it's just to exaggerate how quickly.


00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.360
- How many hours would it take to get the citric?


00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.120
To actually--


00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:20.120
- I think at least 12 hours to be able to penetrate.


00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.960
That's most of the studies that I've seen,


00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.160
do a minimum contact of 12 hours.


00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.720
Temperature, pressure could also influence.


00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.720
I think the alcohol, also the solvent,


00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.400
makes it potentially a little bit more permeable.


00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.480
But I really haven't seen that much.


00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.800
Like, 12 hours is a pretty good standard.


00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.960
Oops.


00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.840
- Method for removing fermentation from cup.


00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.120
Like, if you're just looking for cup quality


00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.520
for inherent genetics.


00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.360
- Exactly.


00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.480
- You want to taste the seed, this is good.


00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.040
So this is what I use to get just like varietal differences,


00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.080
like a naked view of without a processing influence.


00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.560
I'm just like, what am I starting with?


00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:07.280
And then how would I tweak this varietal in which direction?


00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.720
So this is just like a really quick,


00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.680
you can also do this with a mechanical demucilogenator.


00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.880
It removes it mechanically,


00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.120
you try to have no fermentation,


00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.560
but if you don't wanna buy the machine,


00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.600
install the machine, just get the lemons,


00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.920
remove the mucilage really quickly,


00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:22.280
and you get some view of what's my coffee like.


00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.200
(speaking in foreign language)


00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:30.560
And maybe this tastes good.


00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.960
Maybe you can just process your coffee in 30 minutes


00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.720
and you don't have to do a hundred hour


00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.360
fermentation and wait, right?


00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:42.280
(speaking in foreign language)


00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.280
It's like an option.


00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:49.280
And have you ever found that this coffee is better than the other ones?


00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.280
Yes, because the taste is different.


00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:56.280
Some prefer this taste and some prefer something very...


00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.280
Clean.


00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.280
The flavor is cleaner too.


00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.280
Cleaner.


00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:08.280
But you never get over the flavor if you use, for example, orange juice, lemon juice.


00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.120
I prefer lemon because there's less sugar.


00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.920
So it could be that with orange, it depends on the time it's in contact.


00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:20.360
Because yes, the sugar in the orange can give the fermentation.


00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.080
But the goal of that is not to have fermentation.


00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.760
It's to avoid that phase.


00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.760
True.


00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.400
So let's do the lactic really quick.


00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.720
You guys keep going until...


00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.720
Don't stop!


00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.680
So we're going to throw this down and we throw the sugar.


00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.680
Exactly.


00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.800
This is a lactic.


00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.480
This is going to be another process.


00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.760
This is going to be dominated by bacteria, not by yeast.


00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.760
But with yeast, we add commercial yeast.


00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.760
I know that it is dominating yeast.


00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.760
Here, this has everything.


00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:57.760
So, to select the bacteria, we are going to add salt to eliminate the microbes that do not tolerate salt.


00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.760
So, the microbes that produce lactic acid do tolerate salt.


00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.760
It has a high tolerance.


00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:11.760
So it's like a filter to help the bacteria, but it's not 100%.


00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:19.760
The only 100% is what we did with the yeast, which is known and will dominate and will do all the fermentation.


00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:28.760
So for the lactic, we're going to make a fermentation that is dominated by bacteria versus dominated by yeast.


00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:33.560
And in the yeast, what we did is we selected the yeast, we grew it up, and we added the yeast.


00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:38.840
So I know, I have a lot of confidence that the yeast is fermenting the tea.


00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:44.840
Here for the bacteria, I'm not adding bacteria. I'm changing the environment.


00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:48.600
I'm adding salt as like a filter. So the salt says


00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:55.960
lactic acid bacteria that tolerate salt is welcome here and everybody else is not welcome here.


00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.600
Because the salt is a good barrier, is a good screen for other microbes.


00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.600
So we use salt as a sanitizer sometimes to lower the charge.


00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.600
But here I want lactic acid bacteria to dominate.


00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.600
So right now this is very different because I'm changing the environment.


00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.600
I'm not adding bacteria.


00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.600
So all I want to do is add like this.


00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.600
Add just enough to cover it.


00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.600
But I know I want about a 2% solution.


00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.520
(speaking in foreign language)


00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.520
I don't know.


00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:38.520
I had heard before, when you inoculate, for example, that you want to put a certain microorganism that dominates the environment, right?


00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.520
Is it good to disinfect the coffee first?


00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.520
In this case?


00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:50.520
That is, to leave it totally innocent and add so that you are sure that the bacteria or yeast that you have is the one that will grow or not?


00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.440
(speaking in foreign language)


00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:58.360
(speaking in foreign language)


00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.160
I don't do it because I know that...


00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.660
- That there's more yeast load.


00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:03.500
- Uh-huh.


00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.620
A process like this, yes, it can be a good idea.


00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.160
But it's an extra step, which for me is like,


00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.420
even after tasting the coffee to see how it turned out,


00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.620
not changing anything or not doing extra work


00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.840
before knowing that it's necessary.


00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.500
So first, I would do it as simple as possible,


00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.880
taste, okay, I didn't like it, what can we change?


00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.680
We can simplify, make it...


00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:26.520
- And how would you do it?


00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.440
(speaking in foreign language)


00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:37.240
Potassium metabisulfite, sulfur dioxide.


00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:41.160
(speaking in foreign language)


00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.320
for dioxide or dry ice.


00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.760
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.680
(speaking in foreign language)


00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:06.680
and you drink the product that is fermented in the coffee.


00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:16.680
No. So that question of sterilization is not so critical.


00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:21.680
Lucía, could it be controlled in the subject of pH?


00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.680
Lowering a pH that is not so drastic as to kill all fermentation,


00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:30.680
but that allows, as we are controlling here, a specific lactic acid of fermentation?


00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:36.680
Yes, I would lower it to 4, pH 4.5 with a little acid,


00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:45.680
to lower that acidity, to kill the lactic acid, but not to completely prevent fermentation.


00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:51.680
Could that even be combined with the use of a specific yeast that functions in that pH?


00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:57.680
Yes, it could be, but many of the yeasts need time to adapt to this pH,


00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:11.680
So if you lower the pH to 4 and then 1, the yeast will have a toxic environment and it can stress it.


00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:18.680
So those yeasts that work at that temperature, at 1, are very rare.


00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:25.680
Yes. For example, right now we use yeast that works universally with many proteins, with caffeine.


00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.680
It's not better to know, well it's going to take longer, right?


00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:37.680
I isolate and look at what yeast I have in my coffee, because it's going to be different in regions, in countries, in lots.


00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.680
And I inoculate that same one, it's going to be more expensive.


00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.680
Or it's not going to have exactly the same result.


00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:47.680
No, it depends a lot on what's in the environment.


00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:52.680
But that exercise of, well, you may have access to those laboratories, but not many producers.


00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.980
No, entonces sería $5,000 solo para hacer el estudio.


00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:58.280
Para mirar si es...


00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.480
Para mirar qué hay.


00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.080
Okay.


00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.780
Sin saber si es bueno o malo.


00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:08.480
Y después todo el trabajo en la mano de obra para mantener un starter que es puro.


00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:12.180
¿Sabes? Es muy complicado y es mucho mano de obra.


00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:16.180
Entonces, sí, muchos lo quieren hacer porque quieren hacer un inventario de puro.


00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.180
Pero es muy ambicioso, ¿no?


00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:18.180
Es muy ambicioso.


00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:23.180
So yeah, so she's talking about what if we figure out what is kind of our fingerprint,


00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:28.180
what is a signature of a particular place so that you have your own starter culture


00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.180
and you grow up your own starter culture.


00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:34.180
And they said, yes, it's great. It's very expensive to do that.


00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.180
Not a lot of people have access to that.


00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:40.180
And then to maintain a pure starter culture is very difficult


00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.180
because it's constantly being contaminated.


00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.180
So we're going to talk about that a little bit more.


00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:49.180
But it's not a bad option, it's just not the most accessible option.


00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.180
It's an option that's available to very few.


00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.180
But if you can do it, I think it's great.


00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:57.180
Is that starter culture, like a yeast starter or bacteria starter?


00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.180
Well, it would have to be both because both yeast and bacteria are here.


00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:07.180
So to be able to isolate just a yeast culture or just a bacterial starter culture from your environment.


00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:20.180
What about like kombucha, right? The liquid part of the body, the end of the spoky, is that both bacteria and yeast down there?


00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:24.180
It's mostly bacteria and the yeast is on top.


00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:31.180
That's something we did last year, is we compared different kombuchas from different locations.


00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:38.180
And then we made, it took about a year to make a new stable, but we used local fruit from right by the farm.


00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:43.180
And they, I tried to capture the local bacteria and make kombucha.


00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.180
That's a great idea.


00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:48.180
And then, so we just had this giant tank of kombucha, like a spigot at the bottom.


00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:58.180
And we would, you know, we had a lot of testing, but we had ideal temperatures, ideal percentages, ideal times.


00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:06.180
And so we would just, you know, get a couple liters out of the, off the bottom of the tank.


00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:09.180
And every week or so, we would just add more sugar water.


00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.180
Oh cool, yeah, yeah, yeah.


00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.180
And then we'd keep that fed and that would work.


00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:14.180
So it's...


00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:19.180
So it is like, like, that local bacteria.


00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.180
And that's not...


00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.180
And so like, if...


00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:27.180
Because we have a wet mill that we receive coffee from five different villages.


00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.180
and we want each one to be distinct.


00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:34.180
If we use the same inoculation, it would kind of make them all taste the same.


00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.180
Of course, you want to highlight the differences.


00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:41.180
So one of the things you want to do in the future is create, like,


00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:48.180
do that same process of creating a local kombucha from whatever is local in that area.


00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:55.180
And then, hopefully, as, you know, keep it kind of in a clean room environment


00:39:55.180 --> 00:40:00.180
so that it doesn't get re-contaminated with other local whatever's in the air.


00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:09.180
And so we would process each coffee from each village that comes to the wet mill separately


00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.180
with its own version of kombucha.


00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.180
Just like the inoculation.


00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:19.180
I also have a question about this method because


00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:28.180
I think the composure, I mean, to make it work, the pH should be a little bit low, right?


00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:40.180
But when we started the inoculation, we just kind of diluted it, put some dilution, so the pH is going to be higher.


00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:47.180
But so my question is, at the beginning of the fermentation, is it possible that it's


00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:54.180
doing by the yeast and when the pH comes down, that bacteria just come back?


00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:56.180
I don't know, just ask me.


00:40:56.180 --> 00:41:01.180
Yes, so your pH is going to dictate what's working and it definitely can flip.


00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:06.180
It can be at a higher pH, something is dominant, and at a lower pH, something else is dominant.


00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:13.180
It's not that you can say first the yeast work and then the bacteria work, because the yeast have a much more developed cellular wall,


00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:19.180
which means that they can withstand much lower pHs. So even though we associate the pH with bacteria,


00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:24.180
with the yeast, with enough generations, they get stronger and they can actually out-compete the bacteria


00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:28.180
because they're better adapted if you give them enough time.


00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:32.180
So what you're saying could be true if you give it, I don't know, 12 hours,


00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:34.180
but if maybe we have a longer fermentation,


00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:37.180
then it can flip again, where you have maybe the yeast are dominating,


00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:41.180
then the bacteria are dominating, and then it's so acidic


00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:45.180
that now the yeast can dominate again because the bacteria are dying off


00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.180
because they can't kind of pump out that.


00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:51.180
So you can have this like flip-flop, depending on how much time.


00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:54.180
Could we intentionally look for a type of fermentation


00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:57.180
that is first with bacteria, then with yeast?


00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.180
I mean, in beer, I know there are people who have experimented with that,


00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:06.180
Instead of just making one yeast, they make a first concoction with one yeast and then make another one dominate.


00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:09.180
Yes, but in beer they do it more with inoculation.


00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:13.180
They are adding a yeast to it and then adding a bacteria.


00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:18.180
It is very difficult to do it just by changing the environment, just by changing the temperature.


00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:23.180
But for example, in the case of coffee, it could be done for a time without yeast, just with what is in the coffee.


00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.180
coffee, I don't know how to say it, I don't know what is better.


00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:29.180
And the next day, after 24 hours, adding the yeast,


00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.180
probably they would dominate the fermentation from that moment.


00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:37.180
Yes, and that's exactly what we did here, because we waited 24 hours,


00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:42.180
almost, to add this yeast. It already has 24 hours of fermentation.


00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:44.180
In cherry.


00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:49.180
In cherry, and also a couple of hours that it started to sculpt,


00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.180
until we add the yeast.


00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:58.180
So we are talking with Brandon about that, that a double fermentation, one wild and one controlled,


00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.180
that could be said.


00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.180
It could be said.


00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:03.180
It could be said, it's double fermentation.


00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.180
But it could have an effect on the cup, right?


00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:09.180
Yes, it will have an effect on the cup, 100%.


00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:14.180
That fermentation that we are talking about 24 hours, is it the same as oxidation?


00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:20.180
No. It also oxidized, but there is fermentation because there are microbes and there is sugar.


00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.180
It's not the same.


00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.180
Sometimes they work together, but it's not the same.


00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:33.180
So is it practical to take a look under the microscope to see what is dominant right now?


00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:40.180
Unless you have a really expensive microscope, you're really only going to be able to tell generalities.


00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:43.180
You're not going to be able to identify species.


00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:48.180
So unless you're very well trained, it's not going to be that helpful.


00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:52.180
What you could use your microscope for is doing a cell count to see how many are active.


00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:59.780
are active? What's my dosage? Do I have 100 units per gram per liter or do I have 10?


00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:05.380
So are they alive and active or are they dead? But you wouldn't be able to identify species.


00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:12.780
But have you just differentiated the yeast and bacteria? Can you separate these? Is it


00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:16.780
possible? I just asked you. Yeast are much bigger than bacteria, so you could just do


00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:20.780
it on size. You could say these guys are much bigger, usually like 6 to 10 times bigger,


00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:24.380
you could say, okay, maybe more yeast than bacteria.


00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:28.660
Yeah, you could do like a rough idea of size


00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:32.020
and then amount, how many dots are you seeing


00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:32.920
in your microscope?


00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.100
How do you guys feel about these?


00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:36.260
Are they mostly?


00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.540
- Yeah, I mean, it's kind of dry.


00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:43.540
- I have another quick question.


00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:46.060
So like I'm doing an inoculation like that,


00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.860
using like kombucha as the carrier


00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:50.260
for my black-to-guts bacteria,


00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.180
- Would I still need to add salt?


00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:53.380
Just to keep it? - No.


00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:55.420
- Or would that be enough to dominate?


00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:57.860
- That's enough to dominate because you've already,


00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.820
you've done the work of concentrating your starter.


00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:02.420
This is starting at nothing.


00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.500
So I'm doing the salt here 'cause it's the first time.


00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:09.460
I could then take this water and use it tomorrow


00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:10.580
and not add any more salt.


00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:13.540
I could reuse kind of my batch,


00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.140
but because we don't have anything going.


00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:16.540
So you don't need to do that.


00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.420
Let's go wash this.


00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:20.420
Let's go over there.


00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:30.420
