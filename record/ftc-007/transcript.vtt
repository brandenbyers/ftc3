This is not efficient, but it's important.


00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.180
So what I want you guys to do, grab a bucket and start taking out this,


00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.520
putting it in there.


00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.920
And then once it's pretty clean, we'll put it back and


00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.560
then we'll get another scoop as they're going, okay?


00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.360
Great.
