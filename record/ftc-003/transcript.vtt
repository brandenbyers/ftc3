WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
mucilage and then we put it in a tank dry we don't add any water and then we like a honey and


00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.560
it goes straight to the tank it never sees a drop of water and it is still a wet process


00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.760
because wet has nothing to do with water it's just exposing the wetness of the pulp


00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:26.080
then you think okay i can use this machine and i can remove the mucilage mechanically


00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.080
Now I don't have to rely on the natural process or the wash process.


00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.920
So it's like where does this fit in into these like decision-making steps?


00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:44.720
So if we remove the pulp, it's still a wet process and it's washed and because it is so


00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:53.120
efficient, because a eco pulper is so efficient at removing the mucilage,


00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.520
it has the name of fully washed.


00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.360
So we had this conversation in the Spanish group


00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.740
where it was really confusing because most people think of a lavado,


00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.160
a washed coffee as a fermented coffee.


00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.880
So when you see fully washed, like completely washed, like extra washed,


00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.760
you think, oh, extra fermented.


00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.960
It's more of that other thing when it's actually the opposite.


00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.140
It's not at all that other thing.


00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.760
Fully washed, flavor wise, has nothing to do with a washed coffee


00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.040
because you didn't actually have that fermentation step. You skipped it.


00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.000
So even in our nomenclature, we were sloppy from the beginning. We were just very,


00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.640
very sloppy the whole time. And now we're trying to like build on top of this really sloppy


00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.960
foundation of people not knowing what things are. So it's difficult. Our challenge is big.


00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:48.200
And then we enter honey, right? So first we have the machine,


00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.840
And now we have this other kind of intermediate step where we're like,


00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.440
what are we going to do with this coffee?


00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.520
How are you going to process this coffee?


00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.840
So we have our washed, we have our natural, and then this in between step


00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.760
where we pulp it, but we pulp it with, we pulp it,


00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.280
but we don't put it in a tank and ferment it.


00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.200
So this intermediate step


00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.920
goes here. It's a pulped natural.


00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.440
It's kind of like that one because we pulp it, but it's a natural.


00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.440
But from the other way, it's kind of like that one.


00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.880
It's a semi-washed.


00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.000
It's kind of washed.


00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.360
It's kind of natural.


00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.440
So this one process has three names.


00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.960
A pulp natural and a semi-washed and a honey are all the same coffee.


00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.480
You just have to decide which way you're looking at it from.


00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.560
It's like a lot of times people think these are three different coffees.


00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.920
Same.


00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.520
So those are the ones that get really confusing. The semi-washed pulp natural honey and the fully


00:02:50.520 --> 00:03:00.360
washed which is not a washed. And I think about coffee processing is like these like decision


00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:08.440
making points. So the first point is am I going to pulp it? Am I going to move forward with the


00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.880
skin or not the skin? And you say yes or no. And then let's say, so no is natural.


00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.640
That's really mostly what you can do. If you're going to remove the skin, if


00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.160
you're going to pulp it, then are you going to go no tank and make it a honey?


00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.240
Are you going to go into your tank? And then kind of your next decision-making


00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.960
point is, okay, if you go into a tank, are you going to submerge your fermentation


00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.960
or are you going to have it be dry? Meaning you're not going to add any


00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.400
water. And then your next decision-making point is after that are you going to


00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.480
wash it? Because you can still go through the tank, have a submerged fermentation,


00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.920
and then just like strain the coffee, like pasta, put it on a bed, and it's


00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.800
acting like a honey because you didn't wash off the mucilage. It's not drying


00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:02.200
all of its mucilage gone. It's not drying naked. So these are all of the ways that


00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.560
you can combine these steps.


00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.880
So a lot of producers say, well, what should I call this?


00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.960
So the easiest thing that you could call something


00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.120
is wet process or dry.


00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.920
That's all you need to put on the label.


00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.200
It's a wet process.


00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.520
And then you can say, okay,


00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.520
if you want to add more description,


00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.760
you can say it's a wet process washed,


00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.440
or it is a submerged fermentation


00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.440
with a honey drying process.


00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.200
or you can kind of like go sort of round and round in this.


00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.600
So the goal is to know where these words come from


00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.480
so that you can either kind of like detect a label


00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.280
and figure out what you like about it.


00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.280
'Cause maybe what you like about it


00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.640
actually has nothing to do with the process.


00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.240
Maybe you just like that varietal


00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.480
and the process had like a negligible influence


00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.080
or you really like some kind of process


00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.440
and almost any variety will behave a similar way


00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.240
if it's a really, really strong process.


00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:07.360
This was just the point about the decision making.


00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.600
So for producers to say, OK, I made this decision.


00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.480
I'm going to go one way or the other.


00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.240
And now I'm here.


00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.240
And am I going to go one way or the other?


00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.680
And this is in your books as well.


00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.880
So this is-- I like to bring this in for context as well.


00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.280
the textbook for most producers, what people have been working on, working off of since 1963, is


00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.240
this idea that it has been well established that coffee does not improve as processing time


00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:45.160
increases. So the message that has been hammered into most traditional producers heads is do not


00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.520
ferment your coffee, don't have these defects, over fermentation, you can't add anything, all you can


00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.900
do is ruin it. Which again is like a really, I don't know, like it's a really negative


00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.320
message to tell producers. All you can, all your power is to ruin your coffee. So just


00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.840
get out of the way, disappear, be invisible, and just give it to us as quickly as possible.


00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.480
Let us have those green seeds as quickly as possible. So it's been my experience that


00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.560
it's really hard to break this with a lot of producers. Like when we're talking about


00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.400
fermentation, when we're talking about extended contact, when we're talking about these processes,


00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.440
still really approaching it from this point of fear of I'm gonna have a


00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.160
problem, I'm gonna have D-index, I'm going to over ferment and this is you know


00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.240
where it comes from you've always been told you know this is black and this is


00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.360
white and now specialty coffee wants to flip it and say okay now up is down and


00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.240
down is up and a lot of I don't think we're really respecting how much


00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.960
producers like need a minute to like slow down and turn around like a lot of


00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.240
of pressure is coming from buyers to make these different coffees that


00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.760
producers have never made before. It's not like they have this like deep


00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.400
pocket of knowledge to know how to do this and we just like need to ask them


00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.940
for it. Like there's this huge disconnect between what producers know how to do,


00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:10.360
what they've been told to do, and what most you know consumers want to taste in


00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.760
their cup. So yeah. Oh you guys can interrupt me at any time. You can ask a


00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.560
question at any time.


00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.960
I was thinking about the cherry.


00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.460
And also--


00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.720
Oh, you know the diagram?


00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.880
Yeah.


00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.120
Because I mean, I think in Thailand,


00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.720
it's quite common that you have a cherry,


00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.720
and then you put it in fermentation in a tank.


00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.040
And it can be the natural.


00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.920
So I mean, that's why you don't include that.


00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.440
So if you have your cherry, and then instead of going to dry,


00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:50.260
you put it you put the cherry in a tank. And then so for me that would still be a


00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:56.040
natural because it's still it still has its skin it's still a cherry. So then I


00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.240
would say the next question is how are you drying it? Then do you pulp it


00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.680
and then dry it or do you still dry it in its cherry?


00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:14.340
So for me even if it goes through a tank even if you take that cherry you


00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.700
submerge it, you put it in the tank, take out the cherry, and then you put it out


00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:23.580
to dry, it's still a natural because it's had its skin in contact with the seed


00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:29.580
the whole time. So you can get really cute and you can say it's a hydronatural


00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:35.940
because you submerge it in water. You could, I don't know, you could like add descriptors to that,


00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.340
but at the end of it it still had its contact. Technically it's still a natural


00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:45.540
even if it was in a wet fermentation tank and you added yeast to that cherry and you added fruit to


00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:52.100
that cherry, which is difficult because when someone traditionally sees natural on the label


00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:58.020
they would expect something else. So there is this like disconnect of like what people are expecting


00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.820
as a flavor and then what producers are writing down or what they're being told to write down.


00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.860
So yeah, I don't have an answer.


00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.860
So just a day, right?


00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.860
What do you mean?


00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:14.860
That's what I have seen in Thailand.


00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.860
They do this way a lot.


00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.860
Yeah, I think that's very valid.


00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.860
It will depend on temperature.


00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.860
It's not my preferred method, and we'll go into why.


00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.860
I don't love that method.


00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.860
But if it works, it works.


00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.860
Like I mentioned earlier, if it's not broken, don't fix it.


00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.860
That's my philosophy.


00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:41.380
philosophy. The other thing I will mention that we talked about in the Spanish session


00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:47.140
is that I, because these are so confusing, right, these names are really, really confusing


00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:52.740
of is it a natural or a hydro-natural and what do I mean by that? Sometimes I think


00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:58.220
it is valid for a producer to just skip this part altogether and then name it whatever,


00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.500
name it galaxy process. And you know what you mean by that and someone can ask you a


00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.340
question and I don't know that you necessarily owe everybody your recipe


00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:10.660
that you spent time developing. I don't necessarily think that producers need


00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.540
to disclose all of this information. I think you can and it helps with


00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.300
relationships but I just think we like take that for granted that like as a


00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.200
buyer you owe me your 10-step process and I want a whole paragraph about how


00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.740
you made that.


00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.740
So you think you need to keep the skin intact?


00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:34.740
So the date is complicated or, in your opinion?


00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:39.740
So the question is if you keep the cherry intact and you ferment it?


00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.740
Compared to pulping?


00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.740
Compared to pulping, then what is the impact?


00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:53.740
Yeah, I mean, you know what I mean? I think for the producer to keep all the skin intact,


00:10:53.740 --> 00:11:02.740
maybe the thing that you can keep, the chuta or anything, maybe the filament inside the skin,


00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:09.740
yeah, and maybe a better flavor, because it is not lost in the water or something like that.


00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:16.740
So something to think about, so that's a really good point that you, it's tempting to think that if we keep the cherry intact,


00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:21.660
then we're conserving flavor. We're like preserving all of that goodness in it


00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.100
and we're not losing it in the tank or it's not being diluted and that is very


00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.200
tempting but I will say that the microbes that we want to do the


00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:35.460
fermentation are on the outside. The mucilage and like the fuel is on the


00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.660
inside so by keeping the cherry intact you are preventing that mixing, you're


00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:45.500
preventing that reaction. So yes keeping it in cherries a really good way to


00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.160
to preserve your cherry, your coffee,


00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.800
but preserving really means not influencing.


00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.860
I put food in the refrigerator to preserve it


00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.360
so that it doesn't change, so that nothing happens,


00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.020
or very little happens.


00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.680
So by keeping your coffee and cherry,


00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.480
you're preserving it and having very little influence


00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.120
on the seed, on what's happening.


00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.920
So for me, what's your goal?


00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.080
Is your goal to have some maximum impact


00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.440
on your seed, then cherry for me is not the way to go,


00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.420
'cause you're preserving


00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.560
and you're keeping these two things separate.


00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.900
And the problem is it's the prettier,


00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.880
like it's the most photogenic version.


00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.340
So it looks more,


00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.420
it's more interesting to look at,


00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.960
but it's the least effective.


00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.040
And that's why a lot of these cherry methods


00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.380
are 10 days long.


00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.920
They're so long because you're not doing anything,


00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.720
so you need 10 days to make like a little bit of an impact


00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.960
versus a pulled coffee, we can do it in 24 hours.


00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.920
So again, it's like, do you have more time?


00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.960
Do you have more space?


00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.800
Maybe that's interesting.


00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:03.840
So this is the point of view, which


00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.240
is what we were just talking about, that if we are in cherry,


00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.360
our coffee is protected.


00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.360
So our risk is low.


00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.480
If we have green coffee, it's stable.


00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:12.980
It's dry.


00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:18.260
12% 11% our risk is low. When we are pulled it's when we are the most


00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.420
vulnerable it's when it's the most risky and that's why the traditional advice is


00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:27.100
get from here to here as fast as possible. Get from cherry to green as


00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.860
quickly as you can because this is a problem.


00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:40.940
Wet hold was not for maximum flavor it was a reality of the transportation and


00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.940
and a reality of like this is what we can do.


00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.940
So...


00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.940
Too hard to dry.


00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:52.940
In places where it's too hard to get the coffee dry,


00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.940
I think too.


00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.940
We're all in the same place.


00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.940
Yeah, but it's also risky, right?


00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.940
Oh yeah.


00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.940
Yes.


00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.940
It is risky because you have...


00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.940
you don't have that complete dryness.


00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.940
So that moisture allows reactions.


00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:19.300
So yes, wet hold is not recommended if you can avoid it.
