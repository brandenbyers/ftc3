00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My fermentation is still active. It's much slower.


00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We can see that it's not as bubbly as it was the last two days.


00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But we have, you see these little volcanoes every now and then.


00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I still have a bubble. I still have CO2 production.


00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If I have CO2 production, it's not oxidizing. My fermentation is safer.


00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So I can go to bed and say, "I'll deal with you in the morning."


00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And I don't have to run and say, "Oh, my coffee's going to get ruined."


00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So you have that safety.


00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So this coffee now has been here 45 hours, I think.


00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You can look at, Fenty and I just did the math really quickly.


00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So my goal was 36, but we're at 44, and I'm not worried about it.


00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And again, it's not because more is better.


00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So I'm just like people first and process first.


00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Like what is the most convenient thing, that's when I'm going to wash it.


00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm not trying to hit some maximum target.


00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So what we're going to do now is we're going to open it up, we're going to mix it,


00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we're going to take our final data points, and we're going to wash it.


00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And if you want the information from last night, Francie has it in her water pH list.


00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Francie?


00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
[Spanish]


00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
[Spanish]


00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
[Spanish]


00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.920
(speaking in foreign language)


00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.840
(speaking in foreign language)


00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.760
(speaking in foreign language)


00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.760
Temperature, Francie, 22.9, but this is before mixing.


00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.760
So I want to see how it changes after mixing.


00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.760
That, we're going to put it in the back.


00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.760
Yes, it looks like it has a grease, but it doesn't.


00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.760
It's not.


00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.760
It's not?


00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.760
No.


00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.760
It's not?


00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.760
No.


00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.760
I'm going to put it in the back.


00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.760
I'm going to put it in the back.


00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.760
Because it's not.


00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.760
It's not.


00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.760
So, you get the strainer.


00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.760
[ Background noise ]


00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.220
>> And my grease, 21.9, but that's before mixing.


00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.760
[ Background noise ]


00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.220
>> So it's agroechad, we're going to-- I guess--


00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.680
(speaking in foreign language)


00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.920
(coughing)


00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.840
(speaking in foreign language)


00:02:47.840 --> 00:03:15.140
[Spanish]


00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:25.140
So one of the things that came up that Valeria had a question was if we know coffee loses some density as it's submerged, as there's water,


00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:33.140
if we're skimming and we're taking it out after it's been soaking, there's a concern that we're taking out the roots,


00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:41.140
that there's actually coffee that should stay in. And for coffee, we'll lose some density, but not enough to make it soapy.


00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.640
So if you look at all of these, they're very much infected.


00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.240
They're very much insect damage.


00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.240
They're dark.


00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.040
They're just completely hollow.


00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.540
They're very light.


00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.080
So we don't have to worry about that.


00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.440
So every time I open, I just take a chance


00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.280
to clean it off, because that's less work in the sorting later.


00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.120
(water splashing)


00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:18.900
(speaking in foreign language)


00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.600
This is the other thing that I want to see.


00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.880
Even though there was very little activity


00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.240
when we uncovered it, as he's mixing it,


00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.560
you can still see that there's a lot of bubbling,


00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.120
there's a lot of CO2 still being released.


00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.440
Still a healthy fermentation.


00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.680
And you guys can get close and you can smell.


00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.600
(speaking in foreign language)


00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.520
(speaking in foreign language)


00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:20.520
[Spanish]


00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.180
You guys want first two things to notice how clean it feels like gravel. It's very gravel. It's very dry


00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:42.160
And so to me it smells like I was gonna say like a fruit cocktail like


00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.120
cantaloupe


00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.380
Green banana like there's a very fresh


00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.480
Yeah, but like a green banana not like a very ripe banana


00:05:51.480 --> 00:06:14.600
Melon


00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.600
Oh yeah, white beer?


00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.600
I don't know about beer. I've never tried it.


00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.600
It's a bit bitter.


00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.600
Yeah, there is a little hint of low alcohol.


00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.600
Because the yeast are producing alcohol. That's correct.


00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:41.600
Come on, bring the man some happiness.


00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.600
Oh, bring the man some coffee!


00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.600
Yeah, it smells really good.


00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.600
Really on your nose.


00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.600
Very clean.


00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.600
No?


00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.600
So let's get our temperature again.


00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.600
How is it?


00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.600
Is it good?


00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.600
It's good.


00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.600
So you must be a bird.


00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.520
(speaking in foreign language)


00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.520
- It went up a little bit. - Yes, it went up a little bit.


00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:27.520
- Francie, 22.3. - It went up a little bit.


00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:57.520
[Spanish]


00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.520
[Inaudible]


00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.520
Yes.


00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.520
So the fermentation has slowed down quite a bit.


00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.520
Yes.


00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.520
Is that because it's running out of food?


00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.520
I think it's running out of food, and remember there's only a certain number of generations


00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:15.640
that the yeast are active and so it just could be running out of its


00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.600
generations. It's dying.


00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.600
So if you wanted a longer fermentation and you added nutrients?


00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.600
Yes.


00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.600
Would that keep it going?


00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.600
Exactly.


00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.600
Would the acidity still be much more?


00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.600
Not necessarily because as it's going through all of these generations,


00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:38.600
each generation is a little more resistant, a little more adapted, a little bit better at dealing with the high acid difficult conditions.


00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:44.100
So at this point, and this is the experiment that Julie's going to do in her farm,


00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.400
she's going to do an experiment where she's going to add nutrient halfway through the fermentation,


00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.400
at the beginning and halfway through, to see if we can accelerate and keep it going.


00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.000
So yes, at this point, the yeast are very tired.


00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.400
They've had a lot of generations, they've depleted the nutrients, and we're not feeding them again.


00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.200
So if we wanted to say hit 100 hours for some reason,


00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.800
then I would add some nutrients at this point, much more than sugar.


00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:15.280
There's still some sugar in here like they haven't totally consumed even though they're they're clean of mucilage. It's still in the liquid


00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:20.300
So I would go nutrients before I would do sugar, but if you don't have nutrients


00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:29.380
Thing that maybe likes the acidic environment a little more yeah, so lactic acid bacteria


00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.320
So now we've created a lot of acid so now we can use the acid as a food source


00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:42.700
Yeah, exactly. So at this point you could like flip it to a bacterial fermentation


00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:59.280
It's hard to say because they've been in here the whole time so they're better adapted you're not pitching new


00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:06.640
bacteria that is like more into the environment meaning it just hasn't been adapted so that whatever is in here has been slowly


00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.940
Acclimating they're not that active. They're not dominating, but they've been slowly activating


00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.320
So one idea that John Marco just said is if we add salt now


00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:21.440
Potentially then we're going to really eliminate the rest of our yeast that is here


00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.800
And if there's any lactic bacteria that kind of survived that's just been like dormant


00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.520
That's just been hanging out waiting then maybe that can take over


00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.520
I'd add kombucha.


00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.520
Yep.


00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.520
Oh yeah.


00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.520
Kombucha would make sense at this point because the high acidity is already adapted for...


00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.520
They're already used to that.


00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.520
Yeah, they're already used to that.


00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.520
You have a mixture of yeast and bacteria, so you could...


00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.520
Is there a risk of...


00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.520
Are we acetobacter?


00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.520
At this point?


00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.520
It should be like we're moving back.


00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:50.520
No, because acetobacter is an obligate arobe, and we've been not only anaerobic underneath


00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.520
the surface, but we've been pretty careful to cover it, and we still have that CO2 production.


00:10:54.520 --> 00:11:01.520
So because it's an obligate arobe at this point, no, but it doesn't mean it's not there.


00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.520
We're just not letting it dominate.


00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.520
And that's not limiting the balance, right?


00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.520
It's not.


00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.520
Acetobacter is tough because it's one of those degrees, like a small level, we were talking


00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:18.520
about this with John Markle, a small level is fruity and really pleasant at like 10 grams


00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.520
per liter concentration.


00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.520
But if you get up to that 15, then you just hit vinegar.


00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.720
So it's this really thin line between really pleasant, bright fruitiness and vinegar.


00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:34.440
So for me it's a little bit like playing with fire because trying to hit that mark of just


00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.880
enough acetic acid that you don't get vinegar is like...


00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.880
There's other ways to get those fruity flavors without risking the vinegar.


00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:48.720
But if you wanted to risk, at this point you'd need an aeration?


00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.100
It would need an aeration.


00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.140
What I would do at that point is I would kind of like strain it.


00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.140
Like I wouldn't wash it.


00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.140
I would just like lift it up like this and put it on a bed.


00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:05.100
And just put it directly on the bed and then you could be encouraging acetobacter by not


00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.100
washing it.


00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.100
A pesar que no tenga mucho musculo.


00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.100
A pesar que no tenga mucho musculo.


00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.100
Alright, let's get our pH and let's get our BRX.


00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.100
BRX.


00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.100
Ah, so that's a good one.


00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.100
Alright, let's get our pH and let's get our bricks.


00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:44.100
(inaudible)


00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.100
Three.


00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.100
Three.


00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.100
The bricks is three.


00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.100
[Spanish]


00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.100
So if you'll notice, the readings from this morning are exactly the same as last night.


00:12:51.100 --> 00:13:07.020
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.660
So if you'll notice, the readings from this morning


00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.300
are exactly the same as last night.


00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.420
So our numbers say that our friction is the same,


00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.180
our pH is the same.


00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.660
It was a pool overnight, so that's not surprising.


00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.420
But I still saw some activity.


00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.300
I still saw bubbles.


00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.260
So I know that you can't just go by the numbers.


00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.660
You have to by numbers and look and feel.


00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.660
So what we're gonna do now is we're going to rinse this,


00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.260
wash it, and put it on the beds.


00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.140
Oh, sorry, lactic.


00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.340
Let's look at the lactic.

Yeast starts very fast, has good activity, and goes fast.

This bacteria, because we don't inoculate with bacteria, we only change the environment.

What would happen with the one from there that has been turned on practically all the


00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.880
time?


00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.880
If we take it out and we don't wash it, we put it in the bed, how would it change


00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.880
versus one that we do change it, we wash it?


00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.880
It depends.


00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:58.880
I tell the producers to do the rehearsal, to take it out, drain it and put it directly on the bed


00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:04.880
and wash it very well, wash it completely and then dry it


00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:12.880
and in the end, if the two cups are the same, what a good result, because if the cup is the same, all that effort and all that water is removed


00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.880
And if the rate is different, good news because there are two profile options.


00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.880
In each case, it is good news.


00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:28.880
And also, as it no longer has a syllable, there is very little risk that a pregnancy may occur.


00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.880
Yes, exactly.


00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.880
So it may be that there is no difference or it changes a lot.


00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.880
It depends on each place and on the raw material.


00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.800
(speaking in foreign language)


00:17:43.800 --> 00:18:06.880
So, what we were just talking about was,


00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:13.880
So the idea of taking the coffee out now, like I said, taking it out and just letting


00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:18.880
it drip and putting it on the bed without washing it.


00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.880
So that would give you a style of honey because you still have some miso-nish around the...


00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.880
So you did a like a washed fermentation process and then a honey drying.


00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.880
And then John Marco was saying, well, would that be the same or different if we washed


00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:39.400
washed in and dried, what would be the flavor difference? So I said each producer needs to try that on their own.


00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:46.520
So like we would take this and maybe cut it in half, leave half of it and just put it directly on the bed and the


00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:51.040
other half wash it really thoroughly and then put it on the bed and then taste those at the end.


00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:58.200
And if those two cups are the same, if there's no difference, that's excellent news because it means you don't need to waste all that water.


00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.560
You don't need to waste all that effort drying it or washing it and then putting it up there.


00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.700
So you can it's just more efficient. You can just go straight to the bed


00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.700
And if they have a different flavor


00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:12.680
Then that's excellent news too because now you have two flavor profiles from the same process


00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.000
All you have to do is one tiny step at the end and you get two different things


00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
So either way, it's great news. If there's no difference or if there is a difference


00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
And it's going to depend on each place


00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
No, no, no, it's a different place


00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
I've been to some places where there's no difference


00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
And I'm like hooray! You don't have to use waste water in other places


00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.000
