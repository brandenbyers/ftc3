00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So the first thing that I think is really important for producers is to break this idea that BRX is sugar.


00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We're really using this as a shorthand. We're using BRX as another word for sugar.


00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I'd just like to use this slide as a reminder that BRX is a concentration.


00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.840
When we're measuring the mucilage, we're measuring a concentration of dissolved something in


00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.840
the mucilage.


00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.080
And most of that is sugar, so it kind of works as a shorthand.


00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.720
But unfortunately, we've kind of forgotten the other part, that there's other things


00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.720
dissolved in there.


00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.160
And then it's a concentration, so we're just like, "Oh, more sugar, more butter," because


00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.160
we want more sweetness.


00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.160
Like that's one of the biggest asks of coffee is like, be sweet.


00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:02.160
So I've had to like walk back a little bit because I do use a refractometer, as you've seen.


00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.160
I use it to measure the fruit that's coming in and I use it to measure my fermentation.


00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
But it's not the most useful measurement in coffee.


00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
It's not the most, like it's not indispensable.


00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
And yet it's like the most accessible.


00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
It's the easiest to do.


00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.960
So you kind of see everybody doing it.


00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.120
So I just want to remind both producers and consumers that this is not a very helpful


00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.120
measurement.


00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.680
It's a very fuzzy measurement.


00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.560
And this is because we have this idea that bricks and quality have something to do with


00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.560
each other because we want more sugar, so higher sugar is good, so I guess it's better


00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.560
coffee.


00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.000
And the problem with that is that we can have these two cherries that have the same bricks,


00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.880
but they're obviously very different maturity levels. So bricks can be a very,


00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:04.520
what's the word, engañador, like a very deceitful measurement. And so maturity is a good indicator.


00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.400
If you have ripe fruit, you will have higher quality coffee. You definitely want mature


00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.720
fruit to get her coffee. But brix is a poor indicator of maturity. Brix doesn't really tell


00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.480
you how mature your fruit is, how developed it is. It just gives you this idea of a concentration.


00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.600
And what is a really good measurement is color, using your eyes. And so I think one of the things


00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.200
that we've kind of can fall into this trap with coffee is, you know, coffee is very


00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.440
We use our hands a lot, we use our eyes, we use our noses, and we think, "No, we should


00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440
be more scientific.


00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.440
We should upgrade.


00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.440
We should have tools.


00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.040
We should measure these things."


00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.760
And in some ways, that's led us astray, especially with bricks.


00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.320
Now producers, instead of using their eyes to see how ripe something is, they started


00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.640
going for a number, and in a lot of cases, that's really reduced the quality of coffee.


00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:09.160
So I really want to, I don't know, just really put into question how we're using this measurement.


00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.360
Because if we think about it, the brix is measuring the juice on the outside.


00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.080
But we don't care about the juice.


00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.080
We drink the seed.


00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.440
We want to know what the seed is doing.


00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.880
And actually, our skin has way more correlation to our seed because that was the clue for


00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.880
animals to come and eat the fruit, digest it, and poop it out somewhere else and make


00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.880
a new plant.


00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.160
So there's a much stronger connection between the seed and the skin than the seed and the


00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.360
juice around it, right?


00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.280
So that's another problem that I have with coffee, that we measure bricks, because we're


00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.280
measuring the thing that we throw away.


00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.120
We throw away the pulp, we throw away the juice, and we're not looking at our seed.


00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.040
And so, yeah, it's just like for me a very weird backwards way of like trying to talk


00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.040
about qualities.


00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.240
I still measure bricks because I do want to know my juice for my fermentation.


00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.400
So it's not that it's completely useless, but we're not using it in a very, very smart


00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.520
way in coffee.


00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.480
So this is just like a study that did that they did in Brazil to be able to look at does


00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.400
do we have a correlation of bricks and the quality of coffee that's coming from these plots?


00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.440
So they looked at, I think it was like five or six different farms in Brazil.


00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.040
They took different bricks measurements and then they cupped the coffee and they said,


00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.760
"Oh, are the better tasting ones the ones with higher bricks?"


00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.000
And not only were they not, the best tasting ones were not the ones with the higher bricks,


00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
but it was the opposite.


00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.840
A lot of times the ones with the higher bricks were the worst performing in the cup.


00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:54.920
And this is because, so this is just the idea that maturity and color have a much closer relationship


00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:03.240
than maturity and bricks. And it's much better to decide by your particular tolerance on color


00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.760
because what I've seen a lot of producers do is now they want to target a number. Now they say


00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.000
we don't process anything unless it's 25 or above and they're really focusing on a number and


00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.680
I'm trying to hit that.


00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.120
And it takes a little bit of-- a little like a whole season


00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.920
or a while to get that feedback.


00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.360
But then the feedback comes like, oh, your coffee's


00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.640
actually worse now.


00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.880
Like, it's dropped in quality.


00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.640
And the reason this concerns me is


00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.960
because I've been with a lot of roasters who


00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.840
buy armfuls of refractometers and give them out like candy


00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.960
to all their producers and say, hit this target.


00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.920
We want the coffee to be this high.


00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.920
and they're inadvertently lowering the quality of the coffee.


00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.000
So it's much better to decide, again, on a visual range of saying,


00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.080
like, well, what we did, we have a little bit more overripes,


00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.280
so maybe we're going to change our process this way,


00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.760
or we have more underripe fruit, we're going to do something a little bit


00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.720
differently, but to use color as a visual clue and not rely on bricks.


00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.440
And so the reason why Brix still keeps coming up and keeps coming up is because we use it


00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.640
in so many other industries.


00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.920
We use it in all kinds of fruit industries.


00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.520
Obviously we use it in wine.


00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.120
Coffee wants to be like wine.


00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.000
Let's use the tools that they're using.


00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.200
Without understanding why winemakers use Brix.


00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.280
And again, in all of these other industries, we're measuring the fruit because we eat the


00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.280
fruit, right?


00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.360
In strawberries, in tomatoes.


00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.360
We are measuring the flesh and we eat the flesh.


00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.000
And coffee, we're measuring the flesh and then we throw it away.


00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.200
So in wine, this relationship is really direct and really clear.


00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.320
If I measure the bricks of my grapes, I know how much alcohol I'm going to get.


00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.320
It's about half.


00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.920
So if I have 22 bricks, I'm going to get 11% alcohol.


00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.560
Mathematically, at Carbons Via Range, I know how much alcohol I'm going to get, and my


00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:09.080
alcohol tells me how much taxes I'm going to pay. If I'm above 14% I pay a lot more


00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:15.100
taxes. If I'm below 14% I pay, I'm in a different tax bracket. So even in wine, Brix has nothing


00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:20.680
to do with quality. It's not about fruit, it's about how much, it's a financial decision.


00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.080
Do I have enough money to cover these taxes? Maybe I don't want to go so high. So even


00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:32.280
in wine, it's not used for what we think it's used, and again, in all of these other situations,


00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.780
bricks is the fruit that we're eating. In coffee there's so many transformational


00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.780
steps that so many people want to make a connection between bricks and sweetness


00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.840
in the cup and it is crazy. It is just insane that you could have anything to


00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:55.160
say about the final cup quality and your bricks. In fact, the other, the only number


00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.220
that I can really give you as a guideline is that above like 23 bricks


00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:05.220
That's as much sugar as a fruit can accumulate.


00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.220
Much higher. You're not accumulating more sugar, you're losing water.


00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.220
You're dehydrating. You're concentrating that.


00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:16.220
So it seems like it's higher, Brix, but you just have more dehydration,


00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.220
potentially more stress, potentially more unhealthy fruit.


00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.220
So that's why when producers were aiming for 27, 28,


00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.220
these really, really high Brix numbers, they were getting worse coffee


00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.020
because you were getting super overripe, which we've seen higher microbial charge,


00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:42.020
higher chance of defects, and you're losing that acidity that's able to balance out your sugar in the first place.


00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.020
So I'll stop for a second. I see some questions.


00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:54.020
Have you seen like, did somebody would like, initially wanted to get over 23 and then rehydrate,


00:08:54.020 --> 00:09:02.780
And have you seen any experiments in terms of rehydrating of the fruit again?


00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.980
Like putting it in the water?


00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:11.020
So you're saying if it was a really high brix and then they use water to bring it down?


00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.220
Well, I'm not sure what that would accomplish because if it was really high,


00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.020
you've already brought your microbial load.


00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:21.380
You've already brought all of those defect potential microbes into your tank.


00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:26.380
So reducing the bricks at that point is a little too late.


00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.880
I think that's another point with bricks


00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.080
is that it will really change if you do it in the morning,


00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.800
if you do it at night, if you do it on a full moon,


00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.760
if you do it on a new moon, because of how much water


00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.600
the plant is absorbing.


00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.960
It's not a consistent amount.


00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:48.360
You have this transpiration fluctuation.


00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:55.360
So it's not even a good number that is consistent to be making these important decisions off of.


00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.360
So a lot of the times, it's like that "do as I say, not as I do." I measure it all the time.


00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.360
I take this number a lot, but most of the time I want to tell producers, "forget about it."


00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.360
It's the least important. pH is a much more useful measurement.


00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.360
And again, I still do it because we follow it in the fermentation.


00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.560
So this is more like, frix is not that useful


00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.000
for fruit maturity and quality.


00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.600
And one of the things that Alejandra shared


00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.200
is she grows a lot of different varieties.


00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.200
She grows Sudán Lume, she grows Senecafe,


00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.720
she has her Geisha.


00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.920
And for her, her Geisha, in her experience,


00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.120
has never been above 17.


00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.920
That's just like the top that it can reach.


00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.200
And she has this other variety, the Senecafe variety,


00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.760
that goes up to 22.


00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.280
So it has a higher concentration.


00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.640
But if you have that pleasure of tasting her geisha


00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.800
that she brought with her,


00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.160
I tried it right before we were sorting,


00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.120
it is so sweet and it is so wonderful.


00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.760
And she's like, "We just can't get the Senni Cafe


00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.320
to get anywhere close to that sweetness


00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.640
that the geisha just has at a much lower bricks."


00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.280
So this idea that bricks and sweetness


00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.600
in the cup are connected, get it out of your heads.


00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.680
(laughs)


00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:19.120
So yeah, so the point of BRX is it's not totally useless, but it's having it in contact.


00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:25.880
So what we want to know is sort of like ripeness is this complex equation that I made up.


00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.880
This is not a real calculation.


00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.160
This is just a representation of how I think about it.


00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:36.680
So I think about my ripeness being color, and I think about my sugar increasing.


00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.640
And as my sugar is increasing, my acid is decreasing.


00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.880
So this exchange is happening.


00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.680
And then on the other side, I care about my phenolics.


00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:51.080
So the phenolics in my skin and the phenolics in my seed, that all contributes to ripeness.


00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.960
And all of this together gives me an idea of flavor.


00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.000
So my problem is that we've just taken this one element and like blown it up and kind


00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.640
of forgotten about everything else.


00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.280
And the other thing I mentioned about the acid is when we're getting these super high


00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:13.320
brix numbers, we are missing out on the acid that balances out our cup, that gives us that like


00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:21.080
balanced, those balanced notes and the longevity. If we don't have this acid structure, we're not


00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:26.920
going to have a coffee that can hang out for two years. And a lot of times when I taste these really


00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:35.880
high brix coffees, they're very flat. Like part of the reason why they don't, they don't score as


00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.880
as well is because they taste really flat and simple.


00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.360
Because they're just really strong on one note


00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.400
and they don't have this complexity.


00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.560
So this is why in the methods that I use


00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.080
for our fermentations, I'm very comfortable


00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.240
lowering my tolerance for under-ripes.


00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.200
Like if we can pulp it, I want some of that acid


00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.040
to carry that coffee a lot longer.


00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.920
So it's not that I don't care about maturity or ripeness,


00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.920
that I think it really contributes to a cup in the long term.


00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:12.920
This brings me to a question. It's actually not for you, but perhaps also for the registrars.


00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.920
Because we had an issue with Rwandan coffees.


00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.920
Rwanda?


00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:24.920
Yeah, people had problems with the quality of the beans, like the same colour.


00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.920
Uniform colour.


00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:35.840
Yeah, so whenever you use a bigger range of maturity, so if the roasters are


00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:44.040
roasting quite light, they would probably have higher content of different color.


00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:50.880
Yeah, so and then... And that can add complexity you're saying? That can add a


00:13:50.880 --> 00:14:00.120
a lot of, let's say, problems and comments about like inconsistent coffee in their cup.


00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:05.440
So I know what you are saying, I understand it, and then from the opposite direction,


00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:13.480
if the people roast really very light, yeah, they have like complaints about the quality


00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.480
of the processed coffee.


00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.960
So that's just my thought in here.


00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:25.000
That's really interesting too because it also depends on, I feel like, at what is your ending


00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.480
point that the person is saying, like, this is good, this is bad, this is high quality,


00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.240
this is low quality.


00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:37.920
Because it might taste a lot more complex if you have that variety in the coffee.


00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.920
It might not.


00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.640
It might taste like all over the place, depending on the coffee.


00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:50.260
But if you're looking at it through a color sorter or in the roastery and you see variations


00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:56.860
in color, you're going to try and make, like, equalize it.


00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:02.820
It reminds me of, I did a roasting, just a local roasting competition one time, and I


00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:07.180
sorted my coffee so vigorously before and after roasting.


00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.420
My coffee was so uniform.


00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.360
And I didn't do very well.


00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.000
And then the person who won, I asked, what did you do with it?


00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.680
And they were like, oh, I left everything in.


00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.800
I didn't sort anything.


00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.140
They sorted out chip beans and anything


00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.040
that was super damaged.


00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.200
But there was a bunch of pea berries in this coffee.


00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.560
They left all the pea berries.


00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.000
They left all of the different sizes.


00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.720
And of course, it depends on the people


00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.840
who are tasting the coffee.


00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:40.480
But their complexity score was so much higher,


00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.740
even though their coffee didn't look as uniform.


00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.060
So yeah, I don't know, depends.


00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.900
- Well, I think another level of like, you know,


00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.940
good or bad, you're saying everyone gets to decide,


00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.980
is like, is this coffee hard to roast?


00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.900
Maybe it's the most complex, but it's hard to roast


00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.340
and that makes it bad and low quality.


00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.340
Or is good quality something that I can set it


00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.100
and forget it and make a ton of batches.


00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.140
So it's just being aware.


00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.780
So I think a lot of the times, my concern is producers


00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:15.100
don't realize where their disuniformity, where all of this complexity is coming from.


00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.900
And so I'm kind of saying something opposite that I've been like hammering for the last


00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.380
couple of days, which is like uniformity, uniformity, uniformity, right?


00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.480
I want to get everything the same.


00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.340
And that's why I talk about washed coffees versus naturals, and I want to bring up the


00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.340
moisture.


00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.160
I'm like, be the same, be the same, be the same.


00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.860
But too much sameness gives you a flat line.


00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.300
And so in my way, I'm looking at my cost to benefit ratio.


00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.380
I'm the same in these things, so I


00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.380
have to bring in more complexity in these other areas


00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.940
to compensate.


00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.060
So finding that balance.


00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.100
So I'm way less uniform on my picking,


00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.580
and I'm more uniform in my fermentation.


00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.980
And so you have two columns.


00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.100
Pick some from column A and some from column B.


00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.900
Maybe you have way more uniformity in your cherry,


00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.300
and then you can have a little bit more complexity


00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:09.060
in another part and matching the coffee to the customer.


00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.980
Saying like, what is most valuable to the person


00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.820
that I want to please?


00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.060
Is ease of roasting more valuable


00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.060
or something unique more valuable?


00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.500
Do they want complexity or do they want...


00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.380
- Yeah, actually this customer was complaining


00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.580
because their customers were complaining.


00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.380
You know, it wasn't about the taste.


00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.300
It tastes great.


00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.740
They love the coffee.


00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:33.180
They love the price, but because they roast


00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.140
on the lorry pretty light, so whenever the customers received


00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.900
a coffee, they were like--


00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.380
They would just look at it and say, oh.


00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.620
They had a lot of complaints.


00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.100
But the coffee was really fantastic.


00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.180
So that's like roaster education.


00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.460
So a lot of times, it's the roaster's job


00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.740
to educate their customers and say, hey, taste it first.


00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.660
I know it looks this way, but taste it first.


00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.700
And what I see a lot of times is maybe there's a customer


00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.380
complaint, a roaster complaint, and they


00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.940
get shoved back to the producer to say, fix this.


00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.300
don't make your coffee be like this.


00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.540
And it's not up to them.


00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.900
It's like a downstream problem.


00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.500
So a lot of the times it just keeps


00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.460
shoved back onto the producer.


00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.860
And they're like, I don't know what to do.


00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.100
So a lot of times-- so I know because I get these calls,


00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.580
because I work with producers, and they say,


00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.140
I got this feedback from the roaster.


00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.620
They want the coffee to be more X or Y.


00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:23.900
And I said, OK, why?


00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.660
And they said, they just want it that way.


00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:26.980
And I'm like, what do you want?


00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.620
They're like, this process works for us.


00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:29.460
We like it.


00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.380
So it's a lot of this external pressure.


00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.500
And they're trying to fix a problem that's like not even their problem, it's somebody


00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.500
else's problem.


00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:42.740
Yeah, I feel the question "why" is always, or many times missing in the conversation,


00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:48.740
you know, like, that somebody's saying something, but why do you think this should be working?


00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:56.500
Or what, you know, like, and yeah, everybody's just, yeah, thank you.


00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.500
Yeah.


00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:04.860
So my point is not that we should completely throw bricks out and throw away this measurement,


00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:11.400
but to put it in context and to say, okay, I'm putting it in this kind of calculation


00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.980
of all of these other parameters.


00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.300
Here's my bricks, but what variety is it on?


00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.100
Here's my bricks, but what time of the season?


00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.740
Is it early, mid, late?


00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.860
Here's my bricks, but what's my color?


00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.140
Here's my bricks, but how was it compared to last season?


00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:29.900
it needs to be used in all of these contexts. And again, the high, really high


00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:36.060
brix is selecting for a certain population more likely to be defects,


00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:41.040
more vinegar, more spoiled fruit. It can also be an indicator of stress, like we


00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.020
mentioned. If you have a lot of hydric stress, you're gonna have really high


00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.180
brix because you're gonna be losing all of that water.


00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:52.760
So for example, if you have like really plant which is dying but you can see like it has like


00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:57.440
ultimately red cherries, you will pick it up and then process it. There will be


00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:02.280
significant difference in between regular, very healthy plant.


00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.780
So this is something Julie and I started to talk about a little bit yesterday because I don't know


00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:13.720
what it is in coffee, but in wine I know that we want a significant amount of


00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.120
stress. We stress the plant on purpose so that it changes its metabolism from


00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:22.100
vegetative growth. Like if it's really happy it just makes big beautiful green


00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.640
leaves but I don't want to harvest leaves I want fruit so we make it stress


00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:30.020
so the plants like I'm dying I'm gonna put all my energy into reproducing and


00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:34.180
make my fruit better and make my seed stronger so that that makes better wine


00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:41.180
so a lot of the times we want in wine to stress our fruit on purpose but if it's


00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.660
a really delicate balance because yes you're trying to like think that it's


00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:49.380
going to die without killing the plant I don't know if that translates to coffee


00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.380
Julie, do you have any insight?


00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.380
I don't know, but I don't think so.


00:20:53.380 --> 00:21:01.380
But I do know that, like, biologically, coffee wants to stress itself out with its bearing load if the nutrients are available.


00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.380
So it biologically tends to go that direction.


00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:12.380
So I don't know, like, a coffee plant, if it's overbearing and doesn't have the leaf mass to support itself, will just kill itself.


00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:17.380
Even if you don't want that tree to die, you're like, "No way, no way."


00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:26.380
I don't think, I don't know if it's a good thing for cup quality, but I know it's a biological trait, the way coffee's been bred over time.


00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.380
Like, more modern cultivars that are overbearing.


00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:37.380
So I think what we can say is, coffees don't need help being stressed out.


00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:42.380
Coffee trees tend toward stress, whereas grapevines do.


00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:47.700
do so stress in wine is a helpful like it's a tool that a lot of winemakers use


00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:52.580
and it's not a tool that we need to use in coffee per se so I think stressing


00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:56.940
coffee trees out is bad so when you see this indicators of stress


00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:01.020
trying doing something to mitigate it so because again like there's all of these


00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.540
wine tendencies that we could borrow not knowing why


00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.500
saying like oh stressed vines give the best coffee maybe stress or best wine


00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:14.300
stressed vines get the best wine. So maybe stressed coffee plants get the


00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.780
best coffee and we may accidentally borrow that without questioning it and


00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:22.340
saying no it's the opposite. Coffee plants don't need help being stressed out.


00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:27.460
So for me again high bricks could be an indicator of like...


00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:35.780
I was going to say how I have an anecdotal thing about bricks is I measure it sometimes but I really I don't even like think about it with maturity


00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:42.780
because the beginning of my harvest season, when my harvest is probably arguably a little bit less quality


00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:48.780
because it's just starting to come in, the bricks are super high, but it's our dry season so it hardly ever rains.


00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:56.780
And so since we're a non-irrigated system, I have this connection with water that I can see just through the bricks and the cherry.


00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:02.780
And then once the rainy seasons start, the bricks drop, but actually the quality goes up.


00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:07.780
It's just a relationship to how much water the plant is uptaking on my farm.


00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.780
It's kind of wild.


00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:18.780
Like you see, I just used bricks as fermentation information instead of how ripe is the cherry at all.


00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:23.780
Because it's on my non-irrigated farm completely related to rain, it seems.


00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:28.780
I'm not sure, but yeah, that's just anecdotally what I wanted to add.


00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:34.860
So a lot of producers still have this idea, and roasters do, higher bricks, and they'll


00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:40.060
put that on the website in the bag, like, "Only 28 bricks cherries were used to make


00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.860
this special lot from wherever."


00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:49.020
And not only is the opposite true, but potentially lower bricks can have higher quality.


00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:53.580
In the case of Alejandra with her geisha that's at 17, that's way better than her higher bricks,


00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:58.140
and would be with the beginning of the season versus the end of the season when it's lower.


00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.300
So it's a very misleading measurement.


00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.940
So it's, I just like to say, proceed with caution.


00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.220
Both when you see that being advertised to you


00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.740
as a consumer, that this coffee is better


00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.820
because of tire bricks, to question that.


00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.780
As a roaster, to buy refractometer to your producers


00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.340
and ask for a particular measurement.


00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.300
Valeria was saying that.


00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.580
Valeria says she was feeling, she's just like,


00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.700
we keep being asked by clients to do these things


00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.860
that are making my coffee worse.


00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.060
lowering the quality of my coffee because they don't understand what they're asking.


00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:36.620
But she's on her side she doesn't know how to say that it's not working. Like she also doesn't know


00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:41.580
why. She's just like first they do it she's like this person's probably giving me good advice. They


00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:47.020
have every good intention but then at the end it doesn't result that way. So they don't know what


00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:52.860
they're asking and she also doesn't have the knowledge to for now to say no that's not going


00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:56.860
to work or that's not a good idea for these reasons.


00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:57.860
So yeah.


00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:02.860
I mean, it's probably too tangential to talk about, but I guess along the lines of the


00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.860
grapes and sweetness and wine, it makes sense because you can assume anything about sweetness.


00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:07.860
Yes.


00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.860
And the idea that a sweet grape is something that attracts animals to it.


00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:12.860
Yes.


00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:19.860
But since we're having the seed, what is the correlation between the ripeness of the cherry


00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.360
and when an animal would want to eat it and poop it out,


00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.860
and it would grow, like what is it in the seed that's better,


00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.360
the right, like, when it's like, the ideal time,


00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.360
what is it that we're able to unlock through the whole process


00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.360
and roasting and everything else,


00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.360
it's different when it's less ripe.


00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.360
Like, I know it's pouring things into it, but why, like,


00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:48.360
what is it about, like, the plant putting everything into the seed?


00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:53.360
Because obviously there's a realm where it can still be alive and the undergrowth is still popular.


00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:59.360
But I guess, I just don't see the correlation between an animal wanting to eat the cherry


00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.360
versus the flavors that we want being in the seed.


00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.360
Being in the seed.


00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.360
Julie, do you have any thoughts?


00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.360
Our biggest pests that eat our cherries are birds.


00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:17.360
And I feel like everything in biology is after sugar.


00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.700
And so maybe the birds are intuitively


00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.620
like finding a sugar spot where the coffee's just ripened up


00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.180
but they need it and want to take it.


00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.940
Maybe it's easier to pull off the branch.


00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.260
It could be like a number of things.


00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.500
Maybe there's bugs around it that are attracting them


00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.980
or smell or color, but.


00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.300
- But why is it that the seed,


00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.580
because like the seed doesn't need to,


00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.940
like, I mean, the seed doesn't want it.


00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.420
So like the plant, arguably, doesn't


00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.780
want the seed to be consumed, roasted and consumed


00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.660
and things like that.


00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:50.460
So that ripeness for the cherry, how


00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.100
does that correlate to the flavor in the cup?


00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.060
The plants want the seeds to be consumed, for sure.


00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:01.700
Consumed but not destroyed, as in not roasted and ground.


00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.140
The seed, we want to get through.


00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.940
So I guess the correlation between the sweetness


00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.540
and the cherry being in the perfect place versus,


00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.620
Do we know that's the perfect time?


00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.180
Like when is that perfect sweetness for a bird?


00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.180
- Well, I'm hearing two things,


00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.220
which is one that we've really taken


00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.500
this connection for granted.


00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.740
Like it makes sense, so we don't have to question it.


00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.780
And you're right, like we're taking for granted


00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:27.700
that the best time for the seed to be consumed,


00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.620
like that these two things are converging,


00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.220
that the plant is like, I'm ready to give my offspring.


00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.980
And we're like, I'm ready to eat that offspring.


00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.340
Like these two things maybe don't correlate as well.


00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.340
We're taking for granted that that's correlating.


00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:45.180
But the other thing I'm hearing is that, well, the plant does want the seed to be consumed


00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.940
because that is a next generation.


00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.780
And so the difference between being consumed by a bird and being hooped out and having


00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.940
a new life and getting roasted is no difference.


00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:55.940
It is the same thing.


00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.940
It is being separated from the mother.


00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.340
So that doesn't really come into consideration.


00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:06.780
However, the idea that that is also when we, when it is the tastiest, definitely taking


00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:07.780
for granted.


00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.580
And it may have nothing to do with sugar, it may just be what Julie was saying about


00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.700
like, it's just when it's softest and easiest to remove.


00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:18.340
So when it's easiest to remove, and we've just like made this like false correlation


00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.300
of like flavor and taste.


00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:29.060
I'm also thinking it could be then at that point, the seed is like the most viable to


00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:35.060
if it were pooped out somewhere, it would be most viable to germinate in wherever


00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.380
it was pooped out.


00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:41.660
And if we instead intercept it, take it, roast it,


00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:47.060
it has the most stuff in there that turns into tasty stuff that we like to drink.


00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:53.380
So that if it were earlier in the process, under ripe,


00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:58.060
it doesn't have enough stuff that when we apply heat to turn into the tasty stuff


00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.980
that we like to drink.


00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:03.980
And if we waited too long, some of that stuff


00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.060
that would turn into tasty stuff that we would like to drink


00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.780
wouldn't be there anymore.


00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:12.980
So it would be, theoretically, a correlation


00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:17.020
of the viability of the seed to germinate and turn


00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.500
into a plant has the same stuff that


00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.780
turns into the stuff when we apply heat


00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:24.100
that we like to drink.


00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.900
And I think that's the question that I have,


00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.500
is the viability of the seed--


00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.340
- Yeah.


00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.300
- Does that correlate to the tastiest?


00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.860
- Okay, one clue about this,


00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.660
like one beginning clue is that the higher germination rates


00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:41.260
that we have is tastier in like sensory evaluation.


00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:45.260
When you have a higher seed viability, it scores higher.


00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.180
There's a higher cup score there.


00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.620
Why? I don't know.


00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.540
Like the working theory is that if the seed is viable


00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.220
and it's ready to germinate, it's releasing,


00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.620
it's unlocking those bound carbohydrates


00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.580
and making them more available for us.


00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.420
So again, like--


00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.920
- We co-evolve with the plants, right?


00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:07.420
And our taste buds, in a way, co-evolve with the food


00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.260
and the plants, and the nature of that.


00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.200
- Yeah, I think that's part of it, too.


00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:17.200
But what Kat is saying, in a very accessible way


00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.140
that I like to think about a lot of these things,


00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.140
like accumulation of stuff.


00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.540
Like I just have more stuff.


00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.220
I have more tools in my backpack,


00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.940
I've got more baggage, I've got more luggage.


00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.900
And having more stuff lets you do more things with it.


00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.440
So it have more potential for reactions.


00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.820
Doesn't necessarily mean that you're gonna do


00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.420
good things with it, but it's more likely


00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.260
having more stuff.


00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.340
If I have more tools, I'm probably gonna make


00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.860
more reactions.


00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.820
And that's the same principle of like seed accumulation


00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:47.140
of nutrients or accumulation of carbohydrates in the seed


00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.780
as what we're trying to do in the fermentation tank.


00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.980
Where it's like, I just wanna make more stuff,


00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.980
I wanna make more compounds that I can hopefully


00:30:53.980 --> 00:31:00.980
absorb so that in the rest of my seed life, when I'm roasting, when I'm growing, when


00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:04.580
I'm aging, I have more stuff that...


00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:10.580
So I think of it like we're building a bunch of Legos and then as a coffee's aging, we're


00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:11.580
taking them away.


00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:15.660
So if I start with a giant pile of Legos, I have way more Legos at the end than if I


00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.580
started with a smaller pile.


00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:23.100
So this accumulation of stuff I think works both in our seed maturity and in our fermentation


00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:29.060
accumulation and our aging. So it's not a satisfying answer. I don't know. Like and


00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:33.180
again I think you're right. I think it's really helpful to point out like a lot


00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.120
of this stuff like makes sense so we're just like I don't need to look at that.


00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:40.780
Like I just accept and we do that too much in coffee. So like I don't have a


00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:44.700
good answer as to why these two things correlate. I just imagine more


00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:51.300
carbohydrates available to make more tasty reactions.


00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.300
Sounds good.


00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:57.780
So this one is important for me


00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.660
because I really want to break the myth


00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:03.900
that honey processed and natural coffees taste sweeter


00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.180
because our sugar is getting into the seed,


00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.620
which is a conception that a lot of people still have.


00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:14.620
They say it's sweeter because the sugar is going inside.


00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.220
And one thing to keep in mind


00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.700
is that the other thing that I told you


00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.700
is like this is a little yeast cell


00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:27.700
and the preferred food of the Saccharomyces is a glucose.


00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:31.680
So my sucrose is both of my molecules bound together.


00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.080
My preferred is a glucose.


00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.280
So the yeast has enzymes to cut that bond


00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.840
and say, I want my glucose first.


00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:43.720
It will also consume fructose, but preferentially glucose.


00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:47.160
So the yeast is releasing enzymes to break that bond


00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.060
to get its favorite food.


00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.880
And this is the primary metabolism that I talked about,


00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.700
the alcohol and the CO2.


00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.900
It's gonna make that, that's just, you know,


00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.300
basic, it's gonna poop that out.


00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.200
But to put all of the other stuff,


00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.700
the organic acids, amino acids, esters, glycerol,


00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.740
the polysaccharide, all of that is a secondary metabolism.


00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.720
That's the one that, after a certain amount of generations,


00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.220
it's just not as good at producing.


00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.420
So if that's what we're looking for in yeast,


00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.900
that's how we have to like refresh our fermentations


00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.700
and why we can't just use the same starter


00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.900
over and over and over again.


00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.840
And if you know this process,


00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.060
if you know that fermentation is always depleting sugar,


00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.340
then how are these other methods


00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.660
that have much longer fermentation times,


00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:35.380
30 day in terms of the naturals and the honeys,


00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.960
how can they have,


00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.060
how can the sweetness be attributed to more sugar


00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.820
if we're constantly running out of sugar,


00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.580
we're always depleting sugar?


00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.060
So sugar can't be,


00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.740
the glucose and fructose can't be the reason


00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.740
why these processes taste sweeter.


00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:54.220
So one of the things that I like to point to


00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.260
is the glycerol and the polysaccharides.


00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.220
Yeasts are really good at producing these molecules


00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.340
that are like weight molecules.


00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.020
So you can think about when you have something


00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.100
that's really thick and syrupy,


00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.880
you have these like complex chains of carbons


00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.860
that are just connecting


00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.860
and they give you the physical sensation


00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.860
of weight in your mouth.


00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.460
So if you have that and you have these esters


00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:20.620
create fruit flavors, fruity flavors. You get some mango and some pineapple and


00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:24.900
maybe some honey flavors. And then you have these two things so your brain kind


00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:28.300
of fills in the middle. If you have something that's heavy-bodied and thick


00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:35.780
and smells like honey, then your mind says, "Oh, it's sweet. There is


00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:40.260
more sugar here," even though all of the sugar is gone or most of the sugar has


00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:44.580
been depleted. So I think we have this really bad habit in coffee of talking


00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:49.080
about sugar when we should be talking about carbohydrates and talking about


00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.460
like carbons and we just think sugar and that really puts us in this like really


00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:58.380
weird direction where we're talking about complex things in a very simple


00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:05.020
way that's actually more confusing. So that's just one of my favorite things


00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:12.420
about yeast is that it's a very a very easy way to get those attributes. Like if


00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.500
If you have a coffee that's very light bodied,


00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.700
that's very simple,


00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.140
you might've tasted that in the citric.


00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:19.320
The citric that didn't have the fermentation


00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.920
was very bright and was very clean,


00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.260
but it didn't have that roundness


00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.540
and it didn't have that body,


00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.840
the way that the yeast one did.


00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.060
That one was a lot more integrated, it was more round.


00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.220
That's the easiest thing to accomplish with yeast


00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.500
is body and weight.


00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.860
So if you have a coffee that's kind of simple and light


00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.520
and a little bit watery,


00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.980
then a fermentation with yeast is an easy,


00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.180
that's like the first thing you'll get.


00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:44.060
You may not be like, I want to hit mango,


00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:45.820
and like mango may be really hard to get,


00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:48.440
but body is a really easy fix.


00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.860
Not fix, but it's just like an easy component


00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.480
to like give to the coffee.


00:35:53.480 --> 00:36:00.940
The other thing I want to mention is that


00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:05.100
because of physics, because of when we're drying coffee


00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.260
in a honey or a natural, the water,


00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.160
the direction of the water is out.


00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.060
Water's coming from inside the seed


00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.940
out into the environment.


00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.860
And because sugar is attracted to water,


00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:21.060
there's not a world where it would go against gravity,


00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.920
where water would be going out


00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.660
and sugar would be going into the seed.


00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:29.100
That's just like crazy talk.


00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.140
So not only are we in a fermentation


00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.540
depleting our sugar from the outside, right?


00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.220
The mucilage.


00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.540
So there's two sugars, again,


00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.340
because we're not talking about carbohydrates.


00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.000
We have the glucose and fructose on the outside,


00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.800
and then we have the carbohydrates inside the seed.


00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.320
And so the point is that they don't go in


00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.800
from the mucilage to the seed,


00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.160
and the ones that are in the seed


00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.160
could potentially come out


00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.320
instead of getting more concentrated,


00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.880
instead of going in, because the water is escaping.


00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.780
So the other thing,


00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.880
but we know that amino acids and esters


00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.600
do, can cross the boundary and can get in.


00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.000
Those are small enough molecules


00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.680
that they can get into the seed.


00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.100
So it's not that there's no transport,


00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.260
It's just that sugar is not going in.


00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:14.060
And the other thing to mention is that


00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:17.500
in the study that I'm mentioning here in 2006,


00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.020
they found that in wet processed coffees,


00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.100
when they were submerged,


00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.420
when they had all of that access to water,


00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:27.260
they had about up to 90% less glucose and fructose.


00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:32.260
They had less, a lot less sugar that was coming out.


00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:36.220
And that sounds shocking and terrible,


00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:41.740
we have 90% less sugar, but we've all tried a lot of washed coffees that are


00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:47.220
incredibly sweet and so having 90% less of a glucose and fructose isn't


00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.620
affecting the sugar in the way that we think. So we really don't understand


00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:55.140
sugar very well in coffee as consumers. We can have, like you would never say a


00:37:55.140 --> 00:38:01.380
washed coffee is 90% less sweet than honey or a natural. You can find a lot of


00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:07.300
sweetness even though this water allows this kind of reaction to occur.


00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:12.180
So, I'm, I, it's tough. I feel like I'm not giving you an answer. I'm just telling you


00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.060
it's not what we think. I don't know what it is, but it's just not what we think it


00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:18.900
is. So we're not at that point yet.


00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:25.140
So we're gonna leave the sugar topic for a moment unless you have more questions


00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:34.700
about it. Good? Almost lunchtime. So what I do think is really important and super


00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:39.860
valuable is pH. Having a pH meter is really a help. It's like having a


00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:45.900
flashlight in the dark for your coffee quality. And one of the things that


00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:51.320
Alejandra asked is, so previously when producers were so concerned with like


00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:55.080
not over fermenting and not having defects, time was a big factor.


00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:59.080
I've washed my coffee at 12 hours, I washed my coffee as soon as possible.


00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:04.920
Time was the biggest indicator of when we could finish our fermentation.


00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.280
And now, because we've gotten more sophisticated, a lot of people are using


00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:12.280
pH instead of time to end and cut off their fermentation.


00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.840
So now they say, "I washed my coffee at 4.5. No matter how long it takes, when I


00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.840
get to 4.5, I washed my coffee," or whatever number they pick.


00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:28.920
And that's better, it's an improvement over time, but a lot of times the path to that final number


00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:35.000
can be really different. How you got there. Did you stall for a long time and then drop really


00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.240
quickly at the end? Did you drop like what we had with our yeast, we dropped really quickly and then


00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:48.120
we stabilized? Or do you have this like you know really steady dropping line? So my point is with


00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.040
With Alejandra, she's like looking for consistency.


00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.240
She wants a good result


00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.160
and she wants to replicate that good result.


00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.300
So I said, if you're only looking at your final pH,


00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.720
if you're only looking at that number,


00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.440
you're not likely gonna get that reproducibility


00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.320
because it also matters how you got there.


00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.840
It matters what road you took.


00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:11.840
Your curve can give you a good idea of reproducibility.


00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.040
So in our lactic,


00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.000
we actually saw something like the green line.


00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.680
Like our lactic has been really slow and really sluggish.


00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.360
It hasn't moved that much,


00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.320
but our yeast had a huge drop in the beginning


00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.840
of from like five to like 4.7.


00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.600
And then we've kind of been really steady towards the end.


00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.800
So those are gonna have different results.


00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.180
So the point is tracking your curve lets you know


00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.040
if I have a good result and I like it


00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:40.560
and I wanna do it again, I can't just get to 4.5.


00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.440
I wanna help replicate how I got to 4.5 last time.


00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.440
Yeah?


00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:53.880
And if it starts going off, like say you had really good results with the green line and


00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:59.400
you want to reproduce that, but it starts going to the red line, how can you correct


00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.680
for that?


00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:06.160
So it is pretty difficult, but for the green line, we know we got there because our container


00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.160
was really small.


00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:12.800
So maybe splitting up your fermentation instead of being this like big vat, if you really


00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.460
want to replicate a line let's say okay maybe I'm gonna split this into two


00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:22.840
tanks or we know that this line was also really sluggish to start because it was


00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:26.320
a smaller fermentation and the temperature was like more susceptible


00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:29.320
temperature it didn't hold the temperature as well and it cooled off


00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:33.240
more quickly so maybe finding a way to cool off your larger fermentation maybe


00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.240
mixing it more to let some of that heat escape maybe putting something cooling


00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:41.680
around the outside something to mimic what's happening in that smaller


00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.400
fermentation.


00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:55.240
You can do it! So the other thing, again with bricks, it's not that important what


00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:02.840
the number is as much as the trend. What is the behavior of it? And so I


00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:08.480
yeah I find this to be much more useful and more interesting to say what did my


00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:14.160
bricks do? Did I have a whole fermentation where it never changed and nothing happened? Did I have


00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.080
a fermentation where it dropped in the beginning and then it stabilized or could it potentially


00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:23.760
have gone up and back down? So this blue line is interesting. This blue line is very confusing


00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:28.080
because you'd say, "Well, I have a certain amount of sugar. How do I get more of it? Why would my


00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:35.920
bricks go up to come back down?" And that's usually due to the non-homogenous nature of


00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.640
coffee fermentations. So you have all the sugar like in a jelly trapped around the seed and then


00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:45.200
water. So in the beginning we're mostly just measuring our water. As our fermentation is going


00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:50.720
and the mucilage is like dissolving, now it's more available to measure so it goes up. So it's not


00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:57.360
that we have more, it just became more available. And the green line potentially, if we have a


00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:01.680
fermentation that's really active and maybe our sugar isn't growing anywhere, it's not depleting,


00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:07.200
it's not reducing, it could be that you have a bacteria, another organism that just doesn't


00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:13.280
care about sugar, that is, you know, reducing your lactic acid or that is reducing malic acid,


00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:18.400
that's using something else as its fuel and that could give you a clue. Maybe I don't have yeast,


00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.840
maybe I didn't dominate the way that I thought I did, there's something else going on here that


00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:28.320
is just ignoring my sugar but still fermenting, so it wouldn't be my Saccharomyces. So that could


00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:32.880
That could be a clue with, okay, my brix isn't going anywhere, but maybe my acidity, maybe


00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:37.000
my acid looks like this blue line where it's like a zoom all the way down where you've


00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000
got all of this acidity increasing.


00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
So you could use both of these things to say, how do I get the result that I got last time?


00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000
How do I mimic these things, if that's what you're looking for?


00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:56.680
And then this is just the last point where we were talking about oxygen, where you can


00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:01.560
see this metabolism of the fermentation and taking my glucose, changing up, rearranging


00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:07.680
my carbons, spitting out my ethanol, spitting out my CO2, all of that doesn't require oxygen


00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:14.680
inside the cell. Oxygen inside for the metabolism of the organisms, not necessary. That's why


00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:21.640
we say any fermentation is anaerobic by definition. So a natural process that's sitting on top


00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:27.680
above a raised bed and all of this oxygen is still experiencing anaerobic fermentation


00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.600
inside the cell.


00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:35.640
Compared to the opposite respiration, where here we can clearly see oxygen being an electron


00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.640
receptor and electron donor, it's going...


00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:41.640
So this is just to show contrast, not that you need to understand respiration, just to


00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:48.280
say why we say that anaerobic fermentation is redundant, because it's part of the definition.


00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:54.480
And now what John Michael brought up is, well, we say it because we're usually trying to


00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:00.680
describe the environment because the environment will give you some indication of the flavor


00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:06.120
results, like anaerobic coffees taste this way, some predictability.


00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:14.360
And so what I was showing him is that for oxygen requirements, different microbes have


00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:15.360
different needs.


00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.400
They have different preferences.


00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:22.280
So something like acetobacter that gives us our vinegar, that gives us our spoilage, is


00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:28.440
an obligate arogue, meaning it only works when you have a lot of oxygen available.


00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:32.620
That's what, it's like, that's how it thrives.


00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:37.000
That's why in these test tubes, it's only, the little dots are found only on the surface,


00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000
right?


00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000
And so this is where your kombucha comes in.


00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:45.600
In your kombucha, the top of your SCOBY has one population and the bottom of your SCOBY


00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.320
has a different population.


00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:52.600
That's why you have those mixed microbial fermentations.


00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.880
Then we have, obviously, our microaerophiles.


00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:58.280
So at different oxygen concentrations,


00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.720
different microbes tend to thrive.


00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.320
Just like microbes have temperature preferences,


00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:05.240
some work better when it's hot, some work better when it's cold,


00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:10.640
some work better or worse at different oxygen concentrations.


00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.760
Which is why you can have a fermentation that you


00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.520
think is one thing, and it's just


00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:18.400
like every layer, every couple of inches, there's a different activity, there's a


00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:24.400
different dominant microbe. And then we have the other two that are


00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:27.440
really important copies. We have the Cetobacter that's really present in


00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:31.160
naturals, and then we have Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this is our yeast that we're


00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:35.880
using, and then our Lactobacillus that we have in our lactic fermentation. And


00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:41.360
both of these can be found throughout the test tube for very different reasons.


00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:47.440
So the Saccharomyces is facultative, meaning I need oxygen when I'm in my


00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:52.400
reproduction mode to make more new yeast, but when I'm metabolizing, when I'm eating,


00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.740
I don't use the oxygen. So facultative means if it's there, I use it. If it's not


00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:01.760
there, I switch my metabolism. So I can do both. I use it, I don't use it.


00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:07.400
This Lactobacillus is aerotolerant, meaning I don't care. Like it's not even a


00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.880
thing that's like in my atmosphere. It's like someone who doesn't drink beer. It's


00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.380
like there's beer there, doesn't matter


00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:13.220
'cause I don't drink it.


00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:14.860
So if there's too much beer, if there's no beer,


00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:18.200
it doesn't matter, it's not important.


00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.940
And so both of these can be present.


00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:24.180
So this is why a lot of times when someone says,


00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.660
oh, I did an anaerobic fermentation,


00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:28.300
I removed all the oxygen,


00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:30.980
that's why I know it's lactic acid bacteria.


00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:31.860
I'm like, no, you don't.


00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:33.220
Just because you remove the oxygen,


00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.800
there's plenty of things that could be fermenting


00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:36.980
that don't require oxygen.


00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:40.980
It could be a totally yeast dominated fermentation


00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:43.820
that you're ascribing to lactic acid.


00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:46.480
So I think this is why we should be really,


00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:50.760
I don't know, hesitant or a lot more thoughtful


00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.820
about how we name fermentations,


00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.020
because you really don't know


00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.940
if something is a lactic bacteria,


00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.100
unless you're inoculating,


00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.340
unless you open up a packet of lactic bacteria


00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.380
and inoculated it.


00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:03.860
Just by changing the environment, you don't know.


00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:06.400
So I called this one lactic because we went the extra step.


00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.760
Not only do we have a low oxygen environment,


00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.400
we went the extra step of adding salt


00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.360
to reduce, to have a higher filter,


00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:19.160
and I still say, maybe, it's a possibly lactic fermentation


00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.600
because I didn't sanitize,


00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.960
I didn't remove anything else.


00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.840
So again, it's sort of like,


00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:28.440
I don't think we need to be so overly specific in coffee


00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.280
because it's not accurate and it's not helpful.


00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.120
We're not like, we're just sounding,


00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:39.440
trying to sound cooler than what's actually going on.


00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:43.240
So the point of this slide is just


00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:48.760
to say that whether you, as an agent, add oxygen,


00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.640
remove oxygen, purge with whatever,


00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.080
just because you're doing that, the microbes that are there


00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.280
maybe don't care.


00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.040
Maybe it doesn't matter that you did that.


00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:03.880
This is the last slide.


00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.080
So this is just to say that when we're--


00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.280
like, the problem with coffee is we talk about oxygen


00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.560
in one parameter.


00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:13.480
We're just talking about it in the environment.


00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.840
And there's like three levels.


00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.760
There's three layers of oxygen that are important,


00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:19.640
whether it's--


00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:22.200
OK, the fermentation, always anaerobic.


00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.400
Then we have our environment.


00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.040
Do we put it on a raised bed, or do we


00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.000
put it in the tank that's sealed?


00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.600
And then the microbe itself.


00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:35.200
So the two contrasts are a natural dry process or a yeast process.


00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.120
So in both cases, the fermentation is anaerobic,


00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.920
because that's the definition.


00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.680
But now my environment is different.


00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:46.680
One has high oxygen and one has low oxygen, 20% of air,


00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.760
and the below 2% of these fermentations.


00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:53.840
And then we have our microbes, where one is an obligate arobe


00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:55.680
and the other one is facultative.


00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:59.400
So this isn't to say that we should label fermentations


00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.080
even more specifically.


00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.120
It's to say that the way that we're labeling them


00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.760
is not that helpful.


00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:06.080
And so this is more like,


00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:08.260
you're not supposed to know this or memorize this.


00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.600
It's just to know all of the things that we don't know.


00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:15.000
It's just to say, maybe using anaerobic


00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.520
to describe a fermentation isn't helpful at all.


00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:21.600
So it's not to like double down and be more specific.


00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.280
It's to like back up and say,


00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.480
well, what are we trying to communicate


00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.440
when we're describing our fermentation.


00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:34.040
- With the comparison there between Acid Reactor and...


00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.280
- Saccharomyces?


00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.100
- Yeah.


00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:44.960
Could either of those have lactobacilli in them as well?


00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.240
Since it could be either of those?


00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.720
- Exactly, because especially in the dry process


00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.160
that's in contact with the skin,


00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.800
that's where most of the lactobacillus is,


00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:59.800
the peels of and coming in from the field. So there could be a lot of lactobacillus in the natural.


00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:05.560
They could have even more lactobacillus presence in those that has a skin than in something that


00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:14.840
you've pulped and is anaerobic. Yes. So calling a fermentation lactic for me again is...maybe.


00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:21.960
Just like let's not be as like certain as a lot of people come out like "Gung Ho,


00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:27.480
this is what it is. It's like with biology, maybe, but probably a lot more other stuff is happening.


00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:33.400
And that's the end of this section. So now I can go to lunch, then we have one more session after


00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:39.560
lunch where we're going to talk about, yeah, sources of inconsistent fermentation. We're


00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:44.360
going to start to talk a little bit about drying in the afternoon, and then we're going to have our


00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:52.040
picture sharing. So have you talked to Nick? Nick has started a Google folder so you can dump your


00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:57.480
pictures in there. So we've asked Julie to share her farm. Cecil, we're going to ask you to share


00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:04.840
some pictures from Jamaica. You guys can share some pictures from Thailand. We'd love to see


00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:08.840
what your farms look like, what your facilities look like, maybe your tanks you can share,


00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:11.880
your drawing space, something like that.


00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.240
So I'm asking five to 10 pictures,


00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:17.920
don't you think show, you can share with the group.


00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:19.880
- Even when you say share, you mean to see everyone?


00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.520
- Yeah, we're gonna see them appear all together.


00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.520
- Show and tell.


00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.520
- Show and tell.


00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.760
If anyone else has anything to show and tell.


00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:30.320
- Party pictures.


00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:31.160
- Yeah.


00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:41.160
