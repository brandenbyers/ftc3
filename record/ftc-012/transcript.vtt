00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.460
So the first citric with juice is adding more water, he's just giving it a quick rinse,


00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.460
and then we're going to wash it a little bit more deeply and then we'll put it to dry.


00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.460
That's it.


00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.460
Now secar y ya.


00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.460
The lycée of producer is an option when you don't have a lot of time,


00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.460
and you could also go back two ways.


00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.460
One, it can give you a comparative draft, a control.


00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.460
What does this coffee taste like with no processing?


00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.460
And just like pure variety.


00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.460
And then you do a fermentation.


00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:30.460
And then you say, do I like this coffee better as a fermentation, do I like it better as a natural, compared to an earthy pour?


00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.460
And the second one is the option, if you have a lot of coffee coming,


00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.460
and maybe you can't keep up with it, and you can't do 100 fermentations for 100 hours,


00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.460
and you can do something quick and make sure that you can just have the flow.


00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.460
Because maybe you like this coffee.


00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.460
Even though there's a very minimal, negligible processing of this.


00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.460
So we're going to cup that coffee from the previous can?


00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.460
Yes.


00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:11.460
[inaudible]


00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.460
That's the same as doing it with a hand blender if you don't have a blender.


00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:21.460
But immediately, before you make that investment to buy one,


00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.460
you can use a blender.


00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.460
Or if you have a blender.


00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.460
So, the idea of this is to say, "Shouldn't we have just used a mutilator? A mechanical demutilator?"


00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.460
And I said, "Yes, absolutely. This is what we're doing, but if you're a producer who doesn't want to buy one, or who wants to know if maybe I should buy one,


00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.460
before you buy one, you can just use lemons and figure it out."


00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.460
And then say, "I love it! Let's buy a machine."


00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.460
[laughter]


00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.460
What about the waste water?


00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:00.460
(no, it is quiet, it's the same like basically)


00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.460
(same as the place)


00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.460
(yes, yes)


00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.460
(so)


00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.460

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.460
(pero ya está la verdad)


00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.460
(sí, ya bastante, mire)


00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.460
(en un momentico, mire)


00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.460
(pues todo mucho la)


00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:29.300
So maybe if we hadn't done this step of washing and you just kind of use that bucket to just


00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.300
take out the water and you put it out, it could be like a white pipe.


00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.300
So there's still some use to it potentially.


00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.300
But that's not what I want.


00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.300
I want no effect.


00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.300
I don't want processing.


00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.300
So I want fast and a lot of sun.


00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.300
I want this to dry quickly.


00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.300
So what we're going to do is we're going to spread it out like one layer as thin as possible


00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.300
to get the water.


00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.300
I want no effect. I don't want processing.


00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.300

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.300
No, up to here to leave the other half.


00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.300
Yes, the other half. So we're only going to do...


00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.300
But you can still spread out a little bit.


00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.300
And then go ahead and sort out all of these defects.


00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.300
So now we can spend a few minutes just cleaning the coffee.


00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.300
So let's get the other one now.


00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.300

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.300
Yeah, that's bad.


00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.300
So this is also insects, right? Or is it just rotten?


00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:27.300
Usually an insect made the damage first, like made the introduction, and then it could start to...


00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.900
So we want, let's clean up.


00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:38.500
So anything that's white, broken, chipped, insect damage, these really green ones.


00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.500

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.500
