00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In terms of reproducibility and cup-to-cup standardization, I'm not saying it can't produce a good result, because it can, but it's not the most desirable way to get there.


00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, what we're talking about now is hanging out in this vulnerable area. We're talking about extended fermentation.


00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.600
We're talking about days in the tank or days in contact


00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.240
with microbes, with fruit, with other things.


00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.360
So this is--


00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.840
I don't think a lot of people appreciate the huge paradigm


00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.160
shift that this is for most producers.


00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.660
You are asking them to do something


00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.000
they have never done before.


00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.840
And it is very scary, very scary.


00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.880
And all we want is a good flavor.


00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.600
So I think that that's, again, something to keep in context.


00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.660
So this vulnerable, risky time is, again, on the flip side,


00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.740
an opportunity to be able to make an impact.


00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.980
So now the producer doesn't have to sit in the back and hide,


00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.260
but they can actually influence the flavor of the coffee.


00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.660
This is just a reminder that when we talk about picking,


00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.660
it's pretty clear that we see a coffee tree,


00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.960
and then you pick the cherries.


00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.500
And I know what that step is.


00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.500
and pulping, even if you've never seen it,


00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.580
tomorrow it will be very clear.


00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.340
You have the cherries, you run it through the machine,


00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.740
and then you have parchment.


00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.900
Fermentation is still like this black mist.
