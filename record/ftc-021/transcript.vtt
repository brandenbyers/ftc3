There are still a lot of abandoned farms here.

People just don't have the resources to take care of them.

So, the spindly ones, they usually just sit there abandoned.

I was just explaining to some colleagues that the lot that was in the main highway, the lot that was up there, was a gage lot.

Here we are at an altitude of 1,600 meters.

Yeah, so he has the Catura, the red and the yellow Catura.

Oh, okay.


00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.440

(speaking in foreign language)


00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.520
because of the conditions that the height offers.


00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.520
In the lower parts, which are the valleys,


00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.520
or in other countries like Brazil,


00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.520
where the Arabica coffee is also grown,


00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.520
they also grow robusta coffee,


00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.520
which is a tree that grows higher,


00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:13.520
with grains that differ in texture.


00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.520
Let's say that the Arabica coffee has a longer texture,


00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:29.520
[Spanish]


00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:37.520
So he's saying that at this altitude, so we're at 1,600 feet, the top of their farm goes to 1,600 meters.


00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.520
And the top of the farm goes to 1,650. We're about the same height as the town of Santuario.


00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:49.800
I think because of the cooler climate and the lower temperatures, this is all Arabica


00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.800
kind of region.


00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.320
So, as we know, the Robusta has grown in much lower elevations.


00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.320

about a month and a half, two months,


00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.240
to obtain what we call chapola.


00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:21.240
And then we get another two months to get what is called coffee of almacigo.


00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:28.240
And from there, from where the coffee is taken to the plantation site,


00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:34.240

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.920
and once you plant is at least two years

- The first fruit starts in 18 months, but they harvest in two years.

We entered the field here to look at the field.


00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.280
- How old are the plants? How old are they?

- These are three years old.

- Three years old.


00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.280
- Well, that was at the beginning of the pandemic.


00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.280
It was in the 2000...


00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.280
- 2020. - Yes.


00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.280
- It came here in 2020.


00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.280
- 2020. - Yes.


00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.280
- Oh, three years.


00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.280
- In 2020.


00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.280
- The beginning of 2020.


00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.280
of 2020.


00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.280
At the beginning of 2020.


00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.280
It's going to be higher?


00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:43.280
Yes, the thing is that the trees, they grow like this when they are of a very high size


00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.280
for harvesting, so they do what is called "soqueo".


00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:51.280
Soqueo is to pull the old tree, this is the branch, see?


00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:58.440
So they let it grow back and down to lower the height again to have some new coffee trees


00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.040
and great for collecting coffee.


00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.200
Because when they are too tall or they break,


00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.080
most of them break the cups.


00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.960
When they are too tall, they pull the cup and break it.


00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.960
And most of the coffee is now in the cup.


00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.440
So every six or seven years,


00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.720
the soqueo is made to have the new coffee beans.


00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.840
So every six or seven years,


00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.640
what they do is what they call soqueo,


00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.400
which is like cutting the older part of the fruit.


00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.680
Hard prune.


00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.520
Hard prune.


00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.120
Threw it back really far.


00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.520
And yeah.


00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.640
so they get only the younger.


00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.480
- Oh.


00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.640
- The frutes.


00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.480
- Okay.


00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.360
- You can see how tall that one is over there.


00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.760
So when it gets too tall,


00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.320
then there's, well, first of all,


00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.720
it's hard to harvest 'cause it's so tall.


00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.840
And most of the fruit is at the tips, at the top end.


00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.800
So they have to prune it so that then it keep,


00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.080
the growth maintains in the lower part.


00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.760
- All right.


00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.600
How low?


00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.840
(speaking in foreign language)


00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.440
Oh, so there's no...


00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.240
Nothing.


00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.440
Okay, let's go.


00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.040
I'm just going to...


00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.240
Hard stump.


00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:07.040
Oh, I need to stump and then go back?


00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.840
All right, okay.


00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.040
Another one, the lung, right?


00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.240
Six, seven years.


00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.440
When they do those ploughs,


00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.440
when they plough a traditional plough again,


00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.240
it's already a very old strain.


00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.240
Because when you plant the coffee,


00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.640
and at six or seven years,


00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.240
you do the first ploughing,


00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.160
(speaking in foreign language)


00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.160
and then goes back to plowing at 7 years old,


00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.160
that's a 12-year-old strain.


00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:38.160
So there's a high risk of death from plowing.


00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.160
So when you do a traditional plowing,


00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.160
and for example, I usually leave the lower parts of the soil.


00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:53.160
We can see that the plowing is done from the lowest part.


00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.160
The lowest part is the seed.


00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.040
So what happens is that when I come back here to plow,


00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.040
in three or four years,


00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.040
I will be able to plow a tree of the same age.


00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.040
So there is less risk of...


00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.040
-Of course, of... -Of having a lot of death.


00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:15.040
And since I use a large space,


00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.040
as you can see, there is a good space,


00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.040
so what I do is leave three plows per...


00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.040
-Three plows. -Per site.


00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.040
If I have 20,000 trees in a lot of these,


00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.040
So with three sites, I'm going to have 60,000.


00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.040
If I don't have 60,000, I'll have 50,000 trees.


00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.040
- You'll lose money. - Yes.


00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:43.040
And, for example, a month and a half ago we finished the harvest.


00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.040
The harvest is here in October.


00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.040
And this is what we call the cross-cutting.


00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:52.040
It's in the middle of the year. This is for April, but this year it's going to be ahead of us.


00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.040
Because there are many parts that are already very advanced.


00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.480
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.800
So he was saying that when they come down,


00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.520
he lets three grow back so that in the space of one tree,


00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.560
he has three trees.


00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.440
So if he has 10,000 trees, he has 30,000 trees.


00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.720
He lets three shoots come back?


00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.680
Yeah.


00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:16.680
He's also saying that usually they


00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.400
did the primary harvest in October,


00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.560
but their secondary harvest is usually in April.


00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.800
but he thinks it's going to be a lot sooner because of the way


00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.600
that the cherries are developing.


00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.640
It's a lot sooner than usual.


00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:43.600
So he was-- he understood?


00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.080
He was saying--


00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.480
Brenda, the other thing to note here is that--


00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.320
or maybe Cecilus might interest you as well.


00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.120
So this is what we talked about, where in the same plant


00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.960
You have red, green, and flowers.


00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.280
You have the three developmental stages


00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.080
that is very hard to harvest.


00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.240
- Hard to harvest.


00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.160
(speaking in foreign language)


00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.080
(speaking in foreign language)


00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.000
(speaking in foreign language)


00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.760
that will predominate in the coffee,


00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.040
thanks to which it is exposed to pollination.


00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.400
So let's say in a territory like this,


00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.200
where there are many trees,


00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.560
because coffee here is a shade issue,


00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.800
so what happens?


00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.960
Here many forest trees inhabit,


00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.960
which are trees like cedar


00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.040
and some fruit trees.


00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.560
So here there is guava, orange, lemon, avocado.


00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.920
What happens? Pollination is very exposed.


00:27:42.920 --> 00:28:06.420
[Spanish]


00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:11.120
Six or eight months from the flower to the grain.


00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:16.420
He's also saying that it's really good to have other plants, other fruits around to cross pollinate.


00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.160
So the these flowers so it increases like the


00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.680
pollination activity


00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.480
Great Spanish


00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:31.720
Other plant, what kind of plant?


00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.360
Yeah, this is what he's talking about. Banana and cedros.


00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.120
Cedros is like a...


00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.120
Avocados.


00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.640
and the lemons


00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.640
lemons?


00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.640
that's guava


00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.640
ah, that's guava


00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.640
guava?


00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.640
guava is guava


00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.640
I think


00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.640
this is banana


00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.640
that's guava


00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.640
these two are guava


00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.640
and that's guamo


00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.640
that's guamo


00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.640
and those up there


00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.640
those are the green ones


00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.640
- No. - We'll see.


00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.640
Those over there that don't have leaves are cedars.


00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.640
But they're not dead.


00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.640
Because they're seedlings.


00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.640
These forest trees allow you to...


00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.640
In the summer, the leaves fall off.


00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.640
They create an organic layer of soil.


00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.640
And that protects the tree and the soil.


00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:50.640
So what he's saying is that they use these trees because when the summer comes and the leaves fall, they create like this ground that creates a layer in the ground and has like more nutrients, like organic nutrients.


00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:56.640
In the winter, the trees will be flowering and with leaves.


00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:05.640
This prevents the rain from entering the coffee plants and hurting them.


00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.640
What they do is keep the area moist.


00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:19.640
Yeah, and in the winter they have the leaves and they protect from the rain the rest of the tree so the water doesn't go directly to the tree.


00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.640
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.640
It has double protection in summer and winter.


00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:29.640
Yes, because when the tree reaches the sun,


00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.640
it's with leaves in summer,


00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.640
it also helps to protect it from the sun.


00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.640
So it doesn't hit it directly.


00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.640
And do you notice a lot of difference


00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.640
between the lots that have more shade and the ones that don't?


00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.640
The truth is that a lot like this with shade


00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.640
is not going to have as much production.


00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:54.640
But let's say, if we see a lot like the one over there, where you don't notice any trees,


00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.640
you don't see the front?


00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.640
Yes.


00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.640
What happens? That lot will have a lot of production, but only one production per year.


00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:05.640
So what happens? It will have a production, let's say, in May.


00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.640
That production is collected, and it has to wait another year.


00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.640
While in this, let's say, production system, this mechanism,


00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.900
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.820
(speaking in foreign language)


00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:22.740
(speaking in foreign language)


00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:28.740
There will be production once a year, but a harvest production.


00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.740
The rest of the year there will be crops to harvest.


00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:40.740
Because the sun does not enter directly, it does not mature evenly.


00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:45.740
And you would say that in total, closing the year, it is equal?


00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:55.740
Yes, because in a production system like this, it will take all year.


00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.740
And there will be a month where there will be a harvest.


00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:07.180
So he was explaining that in this lot you have more shadow and they have like less production


00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:12.140
compared to this sector that is like direct sun.


00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:16.940
However this only has one harvest per year and this one has like the main harvest but


00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:21.340
they keep harvesting the whole year so at the end it kind of balances.


00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:28.340
balance is. And he's saying that even though this lot has more productivity, it's not going


00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:46.340
[Spanish]


00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:52.340
And he's saying that even though this lot has more production in general,


00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.900
If the summer is too hard and you have too much sun,


00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:58.900
that will affect the leaf and also the cherry at the end.

Yes, to complement the plants.


00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.860
But you also use the less nutritious ones.


00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.860
Yes, the less nutritious ones.


00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.860
And with a soil like this, which is so well nourished,


00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.860
the quantity is very low.


00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.860
I'm applying 60 grams.


00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.860
60? How much would be normal?


00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.860
There are people who use 140, 160.


00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.860

Less than half, yes.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:35:18.680
He went to a translation.


00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:23.680
So he was explaining that in this part of the farm,


00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:28.200
they mainly use organic to fertilize.


00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.160
So they do use fertilizers to like a complement,


00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.280
but they use less than half of what they usually need


00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.120
because of all the, they use basically the plants


00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.020
and they also use the cherries.


00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.240
So once they de-pult the cherry,


00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:46.200
the cascara, they put it as a ferment.


00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.600
- Fertilizer.


00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.440
- Under each tree?


00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.760
- And so, and in this part, in contrast,


00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:57.040
they, you can see even if you go there and touch the soil,


00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.820
that that soil is richer,


00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:00.640
it's like more humid than this one is dry.


00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.880
And when they get high sun,


00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.800
this soil kind of like burns out,


00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.100
gets dry, and that affects the plant.


00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:18.200
(speaking in foreign language)


00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.200

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:31.360
(speaking in foreign language)


00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.360
In a robust coffee, they are more together.


00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:40.360
Obviously, it will have more production, but it will lower the quality of the coffee.


00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:46.360
Because a branch like this, with the flower, will be very thick for pollination.


00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:54.360
So what happens? The tree will provide more nutrients to all the grains because they are fewer.


00:36:54.360 --> 00:37:00.360
So, let's say, in a Geisha coffee, it produces even less,


00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:04.360
it has less branches and even less.


00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.360
So what happens?


00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:10.360
It has an even greater advantage in quality over other coffees


00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.360
because it can provide more nutrients to all the grains.


00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:21.200
So he was explaining that in these kind of trees, in contrast, like for example a Robusta,


00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.900
they have less density of cherry in the tree.


00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:29.040
And if you compare this one with a Geisha, the Geisha may have even less.


00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.880
So the Robusta has a greater production but lower quality, lower density and lower density


00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.880
of nutrients in the seed.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:56.240
(but since those coffee plants maintain coffee all year round, it's very easy to control)


00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.240
(because all year round it keeps graining)


00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.240
(don't give it time to the broca)


00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:08.240
(yes, because the broca suddenly reaches the green grain and it doesn't go in there because it's just water)

When it's ripe, and it attacks when the grain is dry.


00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.240
That's when it reproduces.


00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:23.240
But look, this is just harvested, and you can't find dry fruit.


00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:30.240
It's a scatura.


00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.240
You can see it very well.


00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.240
They produce constantly.


00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:39.240
The geisha produces less and takes longer, so it's an exotic coffee.


00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:44.240
So, if it's an exotic coffee, it takes two years to produce,


00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.240
the geisha takes three.


00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:52.240
So, that tree is a very big tree, very tall,


00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.240
taller than that.


00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:10.240
So, that variety of grain produces about 4 kilos per tree.


00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.240
The geisha produces 1.5 to 2 kilos.


00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.240
And that's what makes it special.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.220
For the harvest?


00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:44.220
Let's say when the tree is 6 or 7 years old,


00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.220
since it's already so tall,


00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:50.220
for the harvest it's very difficult to harvest it


00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:53.220
because it hurts the plant.


00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.220
I have to explain that.


00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.220
But the question is,


00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:56.220
despite the harvest,


00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.220
do you still end up renewing the plant a few years later?

- He's asking Dan about cutting the plants all the way down.


00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:24.380
He said every six or seven years.


00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:29.060
And he said that he can keep a plant for 30 years or so.


00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:32.060
And this year, the Federation recommends


00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:36.060
they recommend to replant more frequently.


00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:38.060
It's a new tree.


00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:41.060
And in four years, I'll come back and plant it again.


00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.060
And I'll come back and have another new tree.


00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:48.060
When you plant it, I imagine that year the production goes down a lot, because you lose a lot of it.


00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.060
I manage another system.


00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.060
If you want, we can see it now.


00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:55.060
You can even look at it from the house up.


00:40:55.060 --> 00:41:01.060
That's why it's my system to leave three trees in one place.


00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:06.060
If you want, we can look at it, because I never keep the farm without production.


00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.060
If you want, we can look at it now.


00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.060
That's why the federation doesn't recommend it.


00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:15.060
They are my ideas, I take them out and they have given me good results.


00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:19.060
For example, we have implemented the production by realese.


00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.060
By realese? What do you mean?


00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:28.660
like stems on each tree so that you can cut one out of three in certain section every year.


00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:34.060
So every year some of the trees are gone and the next year they come from a different section


00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:39.460
and the next year they come from a different section so that there's never one year that's like totally done.

So, two things, many things that he does really, really well.


00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:21.200
But one is his shade, where he manages all of that drop of leaves


00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.960
leaves to be able to cover the ground and then get more nitrogen back in.


00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.280
So it's like a nitrogen sink.


00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:30.120
And then his bananas are potassium sink to get back into the ground.


00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:34.800
And because he doesn't spray, they only use like a like a weed whacker,


00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:39.960
basically that when it rains, there's still a lot of root and very spongy


00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:43.280
earth so that he doesn't have mudslides like a lot of the other farms.


00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:46.760
You'll see like a big old mudslide because they spray, they kill the roots.

There's nothing holding the earth together.

Not only is it less dangerous than just like spinning blades, which is like the standard here

(so he was explaining that the way the trees are planted is because of the of the sun the way of


00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:16.180
the sun so they don't want to have excessive shade so the sun comes from there and goes this way so


00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:20.100
the trees are planted that way so they have all the benefits we have been talking about about the


00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:25.100
the leaves and the nutrients, but they don't get the effect of the over shade.


00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:32.100
So by choosing the direction, he gets the benefit of shade trees, which is nutrition,


00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:37.100
soil retention, but he doesn't get the drawbacks of shade trees, which is too much shade.


00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:42.100
So by planting in a direction, he gets the positives of shade trees, and he still gets


00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:45.100
to have a lot of sun to mature.


00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:49.760
to maximize the solar luminosity of the year


00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:53.560
because one day is not notary, but in the year it does affect a lot


00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.940
and you can see, here it is full of bananas


00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:58.940
but then the sun comes out there


00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:00.940
and it will be all over the street


00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:02.940
so there will be no problem with the coffee


00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:04.940
and the same here, the sun comes out there


00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:06.940
and the light will enter all over the street


00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:08.940
of the coffee


00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:13.340
and if we turn there, the orcs are already down


00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:20.340
[Spanish]


00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:24.260
(speaking in foreign language)


00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:28.260
At midday. In the afternoon, it starts to cover the lower part.


00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:31.260
And all year long, that's a lot.


00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:42.260
Another thing that we have to play with is the sun, which is the most important thing for the crop.


00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:49.260
And more than anything, for a time like the one we've been through, we've had three years of heavy rain.


00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:52.260
And we continue with heavy rain.


00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:56.180
(speaking in foreign language)


00:54:56.180 --> 00:55:20.100
- So he's a very different type of farmer


00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:21.100
from his neighbors.


00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:24.360
No one else is putting this attention.


00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:32.280
(speaking in foreign language)


00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:36.200
(speaking in foreign language)


00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:53.020
- So this is his farm and this is a neighbor farm.


00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:53.860
We're not in his farm.


00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:55.160
He doesn't manage this side.


00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:59.320
- Want to show him?


00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:04.760
So this is just very toxic because they just only spray chemicals.


00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.760
[Spanish]


00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:34.220
She was saying the yellow leaves are lack of magnesium.


00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:38.720
And he was like, yeah, because there's none in the soil because of all the spraying and such.


00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:42.220
So you can see his leaves are dark green.


00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:45.220
It's like a healthy leaf.


00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.220
And a sprayed leaf.


00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:50.220
Wow.


00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:52.220
Neutrium.


00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:55.220
It's because of the chemists who look at the soil.


00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.220
oh


00:56:57.220 --> 00:57:01.140
(speaking in foreign language)


00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:03.140
(healthy, toxic)


00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:05.140
[Laughter]


00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:07.140
[inaudible]


00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:09.140
I can count that one.


00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:35.880
[foreign language]


00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.480
You can see the rain is about to come to us.


00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.480
It's coming.


00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.480
A wall of white.


00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.480
So what should we do?


00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.480
Get wet?


00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.480
Just get wet.


00:57:50.480 --> 00:58:00.480
Find a big leaf.


00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:10.480
So what's your 10 year old into?


00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.480
A lot of technology.


00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:14.480
Yeah?


00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:21.480
Yeah, like anything Minecraft or like scratch coding type stuff.


00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:29.480
Like he's definitely, his mother would really love it if he enjoyed the outdoors more.


00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:55.480
- Well, you have some great outdoors near you. - We do. We force him to go out pretty soon, like he's 10 now, so like a couple more years and he'll legitimately be old enough to help with the chores of the goats and ducks and things. So he'll get to be outside and have fun. But we haven't really forced him to do too much yet.


00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:57.820
(footsteps)


00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:11.880
- Right next to each other,


00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:14.540
these trees are dark green and healthy.


00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:19.540
And just a few feet away, these are sick, skinny, diseased,


00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:21.300
because of the management.


00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:23.700
And they're right next to each other.


00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:26.600
- Well, I thought my nearly 20 year old indoor tree


00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.840
was not looking so great, but it doesn't look like that.


00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:31.540
(laughing)


00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:32.640
- Better than that one.


00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:39.560
(speaking in foreign language)


00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:44.260
- So this farm didn't think about that.


00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:47.460
So the, the plÃ¡tano is oriented.


00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:52.020
The banana trees are oriented in a different direction.


00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:53.700
So they get shade all the time.


00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:55.540
'Cause they didn't think about where the sun was


00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:59.300
or tracking the sun, they just planted banana trees.


00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:03.220
(speaking in foreign language)


01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:11.700
- All right, so he's showing how dark and rich.


01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:15.620
(speaking in foreign language)


01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.740
60. 60 only.


01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.740
Once a year?


01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:27.740
Yes, but to help it grow.


01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:29.740
Before...


01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:31.740
Two months before the


01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.740
seeds come out.


01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.740
To help strengthen the tree for the seeds.


01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.740
Because these soils


01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:39.740
have a lot of organic matter.


01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:41.740
Look at the root there.


01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:43.740
Look. The coffee root.


01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.740
Look at the amount of organic matter


01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.740
that's there.


01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:49.740
Very healthy, dark, moist soil.


01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:54.740
and across the street it's dusty, dry, powder.


01:00:54.740 --> 01:01:00.840
And he's saying they're spraying three or four times,


01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.540
they're constantly spraying it.


01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.860
So he's saying every time they spray,


01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:06.420
they spray between 100, 300, 150 grams.


01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:08.020
He's like, I spray 60 once a year


01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:09.880
just to like give a little supplement.


01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:12.420
- And spray the chemical.


01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:16.500
- There's no drift over here.


01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.100
Really too early is not enough to affect, obviously.


01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:23.020
(speaking in foreign language)


01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:43.580
- So not just this, but the neighbor up,


01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.500
a little further up is completely abandoned.


01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:46.340
They don't even do anything.


01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:48.580
These guys are still spraying chemicals.


01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:52.180
They're not even doing anything and they're full of pests and diseases,


01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:55.380
but their trees are so strong here that it still manages to protect.


01:01:55.380 --> 01:02:00.580
So they're not seeing too negative an effect by having the neighbors abandon their farms.


01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:06.580
The tree is very similar to you. If you are malnourished, all the diseases attack you and kill you.


01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:10.580
But if you are healthy, you receive any disease and assimilate it.


01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:15.580
The defenses attack the disease.


01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:18.580
A tree like this, if it gets sick, there is no problem.


01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:22.580
If the root arrives here, look, there is very good foliage.


01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:27.580
Look, this is the root, and it doesn't have so many problems.


01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:32.580
[Spanish]


01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:37.580
So he's saying he does have some, like this is roya, but because his trees are so healthy,


01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:41.580
they're resistant enough that it doesn't like completely finish with his farm, whereas


01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:45.580
his neighbor trees that are so sick, roya comes and just finishes them off.


01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:56.580
[Spanish]


01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:58.580
- If it finds dry ones? - No, it leaves.


01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:00.580
- It goes to the neighbor. - It goes to the neighbor.


01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.580
- Or it stays there.


01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:04.580
Is it a problem of CBD?


01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:09.580
No, that's what he's saying. He's saying because he's constantly picking and they don't leave red cherries on there,


01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:15.580
when Broca comes, they don't have an opportunity to take hold because they don't want the green berries.


01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:18.580
They only want the red and the overripe, the dried ones.


01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:21.580
But if you have the farm that abandoned nearby...


01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.580
Yeah, but they still don't have anywhere to come.


01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.580
They don't have anywhere to come.


01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:28.580
Even if everyone else has Broca and he only has green cherries,


01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:32.420
They're not gonna bother with his green cherries. They're gonna go somewhere else to look for the red ones


01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:36.580
Yo, otra cosa por ejemplo como como yo no utilizo quÃ­micos


01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:39.340
entonces el control biolÃ³gico estÃ¡ ahÃ­


01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:42.700
Que come la broca


01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:48.300
Hay mucho insetos. Hay un hongo. Hay una vispita. Hay mucha araÃ±a


01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:54.140
Que usted encuentra por ahÃ­ telaraÃ±as que encuentran en los Ã¡rboles. Todo eso va caturando brocas


01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:56.620
aquÃ­ como humigan


01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.820
So they kill the biological control.


01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:00.820
So they throw the plague.


01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:01.820
Yes.


01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:03.820
So, that is a living animal.


01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:07.820
If it knows that I go there and they eat me or kill me,


01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:09.820
then I don't go.


01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:10.820
That's like a bat.


01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:13.820
If the bat is there and nobody bothers it, it stays there.


01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:15.820
But if you start to bother it, it leaves.


01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:17.820
It's an animal.


01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:21.820
Or it feels poison here and it smells, it leaves.


01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:23.820
I'm smarter than you.


01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:27.820
So his neighbor has broca?


01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.260
Yeah.


01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:30.500
Right now, still have broca?


01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:31.140
Mm-hmm.


01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:32.820
But it's not come to here?


01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.900
It's not coming here.


01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:38.660
He said that there's other-- he maintains the biodiversity,


01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:41.460
so there are other things that eat the broca in his farm,


01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.860
because there are other spiders and bugs and things that--


01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:46.740
Wasps and other things, yeah.


01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:48.260
--that take it out.


01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.780
But on that farm, because they spray so many chemicals,


01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:53.420
the biodiversity is destroyed.


01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:55.780
So the broca can just come on in and do whatever it wants.


01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:57.300
- East however wants.


01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:00.100
- Oh yeah, but in Thailand, it just come here.


01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:00.940
- Yeah.


01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:01.760
- Oh, it's--


01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:02.600
- I think, yeah, that's what Lucy was saying.


01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.440
- You can protect with this kind of--


01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.660
- He picks so frequently and he maintains the,


01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:09.620
like he doesn't keep any overripe.


01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:12.520
That there isn't anywhere for them to even eat


01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:13.420
if they went over there.


01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:15.140
Like they'd cross the street and then be like,


01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:15.980
there's nothing to eat.


01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:16.800
- Oh, it's closed.


01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:17.640
- I'm not gonna go back.


01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:18.960
Yeah, this restaurant's closed, I'm going back over there.


01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.880
- Mm, nice.


01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:26.980
- Yes, they are. - Yes, they are.


01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:28.980
They are already picking them.


01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:30.980
- Question for Humberto? - Can I fly over it?


01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:32.980
- Question? - No.


01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:34.980
- There are a lot of them in this park.


01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:36.980
- Will we survive?


01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:38.980
- We found one.


01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.980
- We found a roca.
