00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.720
You can see the movement kind of popping up.

So what I want to show is just having the transparent, we can see the bubble, we can


00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.240
see the CO2 activity.


00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.240
So this is another question of how do we know our fermentation is helping?


00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.240
So the first sign was the yeast in the container and then this other sign is we've got bubbles,


00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.240
we have a lot of activity.

I think I'm joking about us, because it's like in Prague, you know, all the agents come and they're like the...


00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.240
Mr. Ponder.
