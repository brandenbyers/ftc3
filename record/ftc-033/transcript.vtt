00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is that what I want in my temperature, what I want for drying is the opposite of what I want for my fermentation.


00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So in my fermentation, I want really consistent temperature. I want my temperature to stay the same.


00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
For my lactic, I wanted it to be 25, but we had them in a little bucket, so in the day it was hotter, and at night it was colder.


00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.040
colder. And that temperature swing in my fermentation is really is a problem


00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.800
because if I have this like strong temperature change then I'm potentially


00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.040
upsetting my bacteria or my yeast and opening up a window for another bacteria


00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.920
or yeast to take over. So any temperature change is like opening a window for


00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.920
like something else to come through.


00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.420
(dog barking)


00:00:50.420 --> 00:01:04.280
(speaking in foreign language)


00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.200
Come on, guys, we're so close.


00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.440
Silence.


00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.440
I don't actually want to go longer.


00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.440
I want to learn about drying.


00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.440
I just want to tell you about it.


00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.440
And for drying, so again for fermentation I want stable temperatures, but for drying


00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.440
I really want that break.


00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.440
For good drying I want the heat of the day, I want the rest at night, I want the heat


00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.440
of the day, I want the rest at night.


00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.440
So opposite goals for temperature.


00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.440
And in drying, this change is really important.


00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.440
And this is kind of the myth of why sun drying is superior to mechanical drying.


00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.440
I think we're hearing a lot of that.


00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.440
This is sun dried like it's more better.


00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.440
And not because there's something inherently magical about the sun.


00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.180
I think it has to do with these breaks in temperature that allow the coffee to dry more


00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.180
evenly.


00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.760
So, what we want, like we want this rhythm.


00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.480
So this is just a graphic of a seed that is completely permeated with water.


00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.480
And if you have continuous drying, we're only drying the outside, we're drying the surface.


00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.080
And if it's too fast, the drying from the outside is not keeping up with the time it


00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.160
it takes for the water inside to migrate to the surface.


00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.800
So you could be inadvertently trapping water


00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.960
inside your coffee, versus if you have a rest,


00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.360
you dry the outside, you let some of them come in,


00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.520
and then you dry the outside again,


00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.420
'cause you're only ever drying the outside.


00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.680
You're not drying from the inside out.


00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.440
So what happens a lot of the time is that


00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.960
coffee that is this will read perfect.


00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.960
Your moisture content of this can read at 11% or 10.5%,


00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.200
you've got this water trapped in there.


00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.200
So when you put it on a container ship


00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.680
and someone gets it six months later, your coffee's changed.


00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.440
And then you get these arguments of like,


00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.600
well, you didn't send me the coffee


00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.720
that you said you were going to send.


00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.640
Or this doesn't match the pre-shipment sample.


00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.320
And it could have to do a lot with the drying.


00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.240
So if you have these breaks, you have more confidence


00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.120
that your coffee is going to stay the way


00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.520
that you intend for it to stay.


00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.960
So I'd like to show this picture.


00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.960
So this is a mill that I worked at in Rwanda.


00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:40.000
This little corner here, that little triangle, or rectangle, is the mill.


00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
That is all of their tank space they have.


00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.920
And this is how much drying space they have for that amount of tank space.


00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.320
The drying is always the bottleneck.


00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:59.320
So I think it's really frustrating when producers are told you should sun dry because it may


00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.480
not be physically possible, even if they have sun, to have this much physical space to sun


00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.480
dry.


00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.360
Especially, I mean, you saw here in Columbia, where are you going to find flat space to


00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.360
sun dry anything?


00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.360
Okay.


00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:21.620
Okay, so a lot of the times there's not enough space to dry even if you did have


00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.980
like here we also don't even have the Sun that much we have constant rain and


00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.300
lots of clouds.


00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.300
Matt?


00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.300
How much? I mean for the meter?


00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.840
So this range of 12 to 30 kilos of parchment per meter like that's why we


00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.280
need a lot of space and this is actually on the high end. So I'm on a very


00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.600
practical end. I've seen some other recommendations that are low as like


00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.720
five kilos of parchment, like one being thick to have. For me, I'm just like


00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.400
that's asking a lot. So I try to be a little bit more reasonable. Like my


00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.560
recommendations are, like I said, high on the higher end.


00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.040
That's like one ton at a time, right?


00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.540
Yeah.


00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.800
So like your whole production could be five tons but sequentially one ton at a time.


00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.200
of time. It's essentially one time at a time. For here, because it all comes in at once, they need


00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:20.800
all of this space to dry. Here, and I'll show you, I think I have it. So it's got a longer drying


00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.000
time, so you could be more exact. Exactly, and that's why they have all that space that I just


00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.920
showed you. This is the same place. And they have this, they were building this to have even more


00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.800
drying space so that they could slow down their drying even more. So this was for full shade


00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.080
drying so that they could hit like five weeks of drying. And then here you can


00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.160
see the coffee is covered in case it does rain so they do have a little bit


00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:51.080
of protection. So that's what's inside these vats.


00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.080
And when you say five weeks, what is that improving?


00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.840
What is that improving? So I think it's still this myth that if slower is better,


00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.560
or just like our human nature, like if a little is good, more is better. So if slow


00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.160
drying or natural drying is good, then if I just extend it as long as possible, then


00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.880
that should be even better. Not understanding microbial risks, not


00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.640
understanding mold growth, not understanding water activity, which we're


00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.240
about to talk about. So I think it's a little bit misguided to think that we


00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.760
need to dry our coffee that slow, that long. I think there's also a little bit


00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.280
more like confusion and misinformation about UV, saying that like the UV is


00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.800
like harmful to the seed and so they want to dry completely in shade like in


00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.880
the dark. I don't think there's good evidence of that.


00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.640
And so here you can see the structure being used. So there you, I mean it's a lot of


00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.240
coffee that they process in this facility but they still require a lot of


00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.760
space. These are stationary. We talked in the other group about some that rotate.


00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:07.760
I've seen Ferris wheel with coffee that kind of has some movement.


00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.760
For me, those machines are a lot of infrastructure for not that much drying space.


00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.760
If you actually look at the beds that they hold, it's not a lot.


00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.760
So, because of this, I'm a huge, huge fan of mechanical drying.


00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:26.760
I think mechanical dryers are fantastic and you can create really great, high-quality coffee in a mechanical dryer.


00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.760
We've just been using the tool wrong.


00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.680
We've been using the tool as a full force,


00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.840
really consistent drying machine.


00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.880
So in sun, you really can't hurry up the sun.


00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.880
It has to be night.


00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.480
There will always be night.


00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.360
So you have built in breaks, built in rests.


00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.360
But with the machine, there's no breaks.


00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.440
So coffee producers are drying their coffee in 60 hours


00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.240
at 70 degrees, like you're basically pre-cooking.


00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.000
And then everyone's like, oh, machines are the worst.


00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.520
And machine coffees are-- machine-dried coffees


00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.120
are going to give you low-quality coffee, which


00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.640
we saw, yes, because it bursts all your structures,


00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.440
your oils come out, your volatiles come out,


00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.720
and yes, the coffee's worse.


00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.640
But it doesn't have to be that way.


00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.680
So using our machines to mimic nature,


00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.000
lowering the temperature, giving those positives,


00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.480
is an opportunity to have really high-quality coffee


00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.480
with machines and not sacrifice quality.


00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:32.440
So the other things that can be


00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.040
like something to keep in mind, again,


00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.480
not everybody has the space to sub-dry,


00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.320
so machine may be your only option.


00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.920
And asking somebody to have a machine that works 24 hours


00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.160
and only to turn it on for four or six,


00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.840
I get a lot of pushback of like,


00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.080
but I bought it so that I could dry very quickly.


00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.240
And I'm not gonna, my machine should be running 24 hours


00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.760
and you're only asking me to run it four,


00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.600
like that's really inefficient.


00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.040
So what I tell producers is you can run it 24 hours


00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.660
just with different coffee.


00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.800
So run it for eight hours with one batch,


00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.160
switch out your coffee, do that for eight hours


00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.100
and then switch out your coffee.


00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.020
So you can dry three coffees, never stop your machine,


00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.280
but you're still giving the coffee those breaks.


00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.840
So you can still run it full,


00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.120
it's still a slightly lower temperature.


00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.080
- But there are no commercial mechanical dryers


00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.440
that are focusing on efficiency


00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.880
in a more day-night kind of cycle


00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.000
that you're talking about.


00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.760
They're all meant to be run long periods of time.


00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.320
- Yeah, they're all like,


00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.640
and the other kind of drawback to mechanical drying


00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.400
is that especially with the Guardiola,


00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.240
they're most efficient at full volume.


00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.560
So they're really like one unit machines


00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.760
because the coffee that goes in here, so this will rotate.


00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.360
And if there's not enough coffee,


00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.880
you don't get enough of that rotation.


00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.120
So you need to fill it to like 85% capacity to run it fast.


00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.640
You can't just have a little bit of coffee


00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.840
that I need to dry.


00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.680
So that's, drawback to the Guardiola,


00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.960
I really like this type of dryer though


00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.680
because the heat is coming from the middle out.


00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.600
So it's like multi-directional, really even heat


00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.520
and you're rotating very slowly.


00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.720
So you have that evenness compared to the,


00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.600
another really common system here in Colombia is a silo.


00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.800
So it's like a tall column,


00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.120
and the heat is only coming from the bottom,


00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.040
kind of pushing up, so there's no agitation.


00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.800
But people like it because it has multiple compartments.


00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.960
So you can put your wettest coffee at the bottom,


00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.920
and then when it dries, you can kind of move it up,


00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.320
and then your most dry coffee goes at the top,


00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.000
so you have less heat coming towards it.


00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.060
But I still feel like that creates a lot of opportunity


00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.100
for inconsistency because you're not moving the coffee.


00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.400
It's just coffee coming from the bottom, kind of through it.


00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.560
And--


00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.320
But Guardiola is the style where it's like a spinning drum.


00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.200
Yeah.


00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.440
So different companies make Guardiolas.


00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.080
So Pinalencia will make a Guardiola.


00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.440
Penergos would make a Guardiola.


00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.360
So yeah, Guardiola is the style, not the company


00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.680
that makes them.


00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.600
And I think they're kind of becoming more savvy to this,


00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.520
that they're making them with multiple compartments


00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.960
so that you can dry different batches of coffee


00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.000
in the same machine and you're not having to load and unload


00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.200
as much, so they're getting better as well.


00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.880
Compartmentalizing it then like this way, like vertically.


00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.720
I'm not sure if the compartments are like in the cylinder,


00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.720
like kind of half and half or that way.


00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.640
But yeah, just.


00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.480
- If it's a hundred kilo,


00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.000
right, they have a divide,


00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.480
so you can make it a 50 kilo


00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.280
if you don't have enough coffee to fill the hundred.


00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.120
- Yeah.


00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.040
- Okay, I have to jump back a little bit to fermentation


00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.000
because it's like we have roasting in drums,


00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.880
we have drying in drums.


00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:54.720
- Why are we fermenting in drums?


00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.120
- We have full agitation in drums.


00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.080
- That's what I would love.


00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.680
I would love, like if I can have a gordiello


00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.560
without the holes and ferment in that,


00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.440
or I'd mention like a cement mixer,


00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.360
like something that has that soft--


00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.600
- So it's not like, that doesn't disturb microbes


00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.000
too much or anything like that?


00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.520
- Not the ones that I use.


00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.480
So I would like that really well with the yeast.


00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.960
It could be that you have a microbe


00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.440
that's more delicate to agitation and wouldn't like that,


00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.400
wouldn't want to constantly be disturbed,


00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.240
or you may wanna preserve some kind of environment.


00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.800
So I don't think it's the best for everything,


00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.520
but I think it would be really, really good for the yeast.


00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.680
And also like a slow rotation.


00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.680
Very slow.


00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.680
But that would create more consistency and...


00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.680
And less work for Sebastiano to like be constantly...


00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.680
Yeah, moving.


00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.680
What did you think about the touchpad?


00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:49.680
So this is one of these static dryers.


00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.680
That...


00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.680
Again, like, it's a tool.


00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.680
So I don't think any tool is good or bad.


00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.680
It's like how do you use it.


00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:09.220
So you can see that has the multiple compartments so that you can have different batches and


00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:14.380
so that the heat is coming from the bottom so this one is getting hotter than this one.


00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.380
Yeah.


00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:23.660
What about the moisture which is like going through the... yeah I don't love it.


00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:28.160
Well, for example, so in Ecuador, they start by drying in the sun.


00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:33.160
And then at around like 2018 or something in the winter,


00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.160
they start using the mechanical dryer.


00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.660
But they have like some--


00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.660
I don't like that.


00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.160
I don't recommend that.


00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.660
So it's very, very common a lot of the times to start in the sun


00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.660
and then switch to machine.


00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.660
I think that's--


00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160
I don't like to say anything is wrong.


00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.160
Because it depends how you use it.


00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.160
But for me, I don't think that's a good way to dry coffee.


00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.160
I like to flip it.


00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:07.160
Because the sun, you have these automatic breaks of pausing because it's night time.


00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.160
And the machines, they tend to be run really hot.


00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.160
So the error that I see most people do is they start in the sun where it's more gentle.


00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
And then they get like impatient.


00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.160
And they just want the coffee to dry or they run out of time.


00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:26.160
And then they put it in the machine when the coffee is the most brutal and it has a higher temperature.


00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.160
So then they end up damaging their coffee at the end.


00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:34.160
So I would flip it. I would machine dry first when you have your highest moisture


00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:39.160
so that you have the most buffer, the most resistance, like the coffee is the most resilient.


00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:45.160
Machine dry first and then if you don't have enough space, then go to the sun where you have more gentle drying.


00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.160
or you can take more time.


00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.160
But don't you think that this is what happens, you seal this moisture


00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.160
with really excessive heat in the machine at the beginning?


00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.160
Because this is the same as what you just mentioned,


00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.160
it's the same as the roasting,


00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.160
you just put it at a really high temperature,


00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.160
it will just seal all this moisture from the inside, and basically...


00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.160
Well, I still don't ever recommend high temperatures in your machine.


00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
You should still never be doing that.


00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.280
But at that point, especially because we know water doesn't evenly come off,


00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:25.120
like doesn't it, the least tightly bound water comes off first. So you still have that buffer


00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:33.040
and then later on it takes more effort to unbind that water. So for me in the beginning it is the


00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.400
most readily available. So it's not going to be trapped inside. You still need to get that free


00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.400
water.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.400
[dog barking]


00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:51.400
It's very difficult to find a small dry.


00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:58.400
So what you do is you keep piping, keep drying, and building your volume until you can fill


00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.400
up the mechanical dry.


00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.400
So it's almost impossible for you to mechanical dry first.


00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.400
You do it first.


00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:10.400
And then you just control, so at night you turn off the heat, but leave it turning.


00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.400
And every day you turn on that to heat.


00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.400
So, you're pretending to be the sun.


00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.400
You're pretending to be the sun, that's the point. Yeah, you're mimicking nature.


00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.400
And you keep it, keep it lower than you would normally.


00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.400
So, instead of 40, maybe you keep it at 20, or 30.


00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.400
Yeah.


00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.400
So that could work.


00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.400
Yes.

Yeah, no, on the bench.

Oh, that, I mean, that's the other thing.


00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.660
If you think about how many people it takes to...


00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.660
I mean, and these coffees are moved every hour.


00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.660
Is that right?


00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:31.660
Yes. So I have pictures and they just have a hundred people just moving coffee.


00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.660
Doing nothing else. Just move coffee all day long.


00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:41.660

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.660

(dog barking)


00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.020
- Okay, go ahead.


00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:02.380
- So, nature's awesome, but like,


00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.940
why is it again, that like, why does that cycle?


00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:06.780
- The cycle matters.


00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:07.880
- Is it, we're talking about just for storage,


00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.460
or for longevity?


00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.300
- Yeah.


00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.940
- It gives a chance for the water inside


00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.380
to migrate to the outside. - Mostly.


00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.380
- Okay, so it's migrating. - Right, so the break


00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.980
is important for this, for give the water enough time


00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.140
from the inner layer and the inner tissue layers


00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.960
to migrate to the outside and to not trap water


00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.620
because any water that you trap inside


00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.780
is water that's available for a reaction.


00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.480
It's water that's available to change your coffee.


00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.140
- When you store your coffee, you rehydrate your coffee.


00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.140
- Okay, and so like, at first, it's all kind of


00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.060
available because it's all kind of together,


00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.900
so it's not like sealed off on the outside,


00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.620
so it's all kind of moving.


00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.200
And then you're ensuring that then


00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.740
whatever has the outer form, then it cools


00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.820
and allows that then to disperse out again.


00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:53.660
- Exactly.


00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.500
- Okay, so you're allowing the water


00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.540
to continue to come out.


00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.700
- To continually come out, yes.


00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.540
Exactly.


00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.820
You're allowing the water to continually come out,


00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.460
like to catch up.


00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.860
So it takes a, it's not super well understood


00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.060
how water is coming out.


00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.020
There's some capillary action, there's some diffusion,


00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.660
there's like, there's a lot of methods


00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.540
and however tightly bound the water is for it to come out,


00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.660
but it takes time.


00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.340
So if we're drying at a faster rate


00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.180
that we're letting that action happen,


00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.500
that's when the trapping happens.


00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.220
- So it's not necessarily a day-night cycle,


00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.380
it's just that somehow that has to happen.


00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.220
- Yeah.


00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.040
- It has to occur.


00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.620
- Where we are down, 'cause up in the mountain


00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.300
we can't dry anything, it's just always so humid.


00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.100
So down in the valley, it's really hot, really sunny,


00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.660
kind of a little hotter than this.


00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:47.140
So we actually have to take it a step further


00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.480
and dry every other day.


00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.080
- Give it a bigger break.


00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.500
- So the first few days we'll dry every day


00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.540
to get most of the water out.


00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.380
And then, yeah, then from about,


00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:04.220
once the moisture's down to 25, 30,


00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.220
we'll dry every other,


00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.660
to where there's no danger of mold or,


00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:09.700
like the honey process,


00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.940
we might get a little down to 20 or so.


00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.940
But then the last week or so,


00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.940
where they go cover and uncover every other day,


00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:21.940
just to give it a chance to be even out.


00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.940
Yeah, exactly what you're saying.


00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.940
Yeah, and there's nothing magical about like 12 and 12 hours.


00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.940
If you need 24 and 24 or longer breaks,


00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:34.940
it's just having that opportunity for the inner moisture to catch up.


00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.940
And what Renata was asking was,


00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.940
if I'm recommending machine first and then sun,


00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.940
which is usually the opposite,


00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.780
traditionally it's sun first and then we're impatient,


00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.460
just put it in the machine and get it out of here.


00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.980
If I'm recommending the opposite of machine first,


00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.420
she's saying, well, am I not creating the conditions


00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.260
I'm trying to avoid?


00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.700
If I'm putting it in the machine first,


00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.220
aren't I trapping, making kind of like a crust


00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.540
on the outside?


00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.540
And I'm saying, no, because I still never wanna run


00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.580
the machine that hot.


00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.500
I still never recommend it to run the machine that hot


00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.800
that that happens.


00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.780
And in the beginning, getting the temperature,


00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:16.700
getting the moisture down at least to that low 25% and like that to go quickly is very


00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.220
important for stability and to prevent microbial growth.


00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.900
So I do want to go much faster in the beginning because I have way more free water that is


00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:30.860
going to come off and that is the point where the seed is the most robust, is the most protected.


00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:36.700
That water gives it that opportunity to take a little bit more energy and not get brittle


00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.060
and get hurt.


00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:43.220
So I would rather get through those 25% as quickly as possible without putting it at


00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.220
70 Celsius.


00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:49.900
Still trying to maintain a reasonable amount of heat, but getting there quickly.


00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:55.100
And then from 20 to 12, I can take a lot more of my time, let it stabilize, homogenize,


00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:01.860
the moisture that's inside, but I've lowered, I've reduced my risk of microbial activity


00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:02.860
significantly.


00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:12.860
I think it also can depend on if you use the cherry as a final product to try, or parchment,


00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:18.860
because in a way with the cherry I think you can start even higher and with the parchment lower.


00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.860
Because this is also like cut away with the roasting, washed coffee, I don't know,


00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:27.860
after you finish washed coffee you can just dump it at like crazy temperatures and it will be fine in the beginning,


00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:32.860
You don't want to really seal it, but with a natural it's very more fragile.


00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:38.860
So with a natural you want to get slightly lower when you insert the instant jump.


00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:44.860
So maybe this is also the case, like for you to go slightly lower if you're on the cherry,


00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.860
then you just can't afford yourself to go a bit higher.


00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.860
Because again, what you say, there is extra work to do.


00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.860
That makes sense. I just don't work with naturals.


00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.860
I don't work with cherries, so I don't give recommendations on cherries.


00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.660
on cherries, but yes, that makes sense.


00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.660
Can you put the cherries in the baguette mold?


00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.940
Yeah, you can.


00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.340
And that's the only place where you do have to do sun first


00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.060
to get it dry enough of water so that you can put them


00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.340
into the machine because you're just


00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.740
going to corrode your machine.


00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.780
But it's an option that a lot of producers have to use.


00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.300
Is there any magic temperature number to not form a crust


00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.780
so that any rust afterwards would still happen?


00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.220
Well, we talked about above 40 Celsius,


00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.940
and you start to see that cellular damage.


00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.780
But that has to do with cellular integrity, not necessarily


00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.020
forming a crust.


00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.700
So I think the crust has more to do


00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.340
with the rate of drying on the outside


00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.380
to rate of water coming out from the inside.


00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.020
And so that ratio.


00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.420
So it's more of that ratio versus the temperature.


00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.620
But it's not a permanent crust though, right?


00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.020
Because you could rest long enough to catch up.


00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.020
I mean, compared to the--


00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:53.740
Exactly.


00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:54.260
Exactly.


00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.580
it's not a permanent crust, which is a problem


00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.260
because it's not a permanent crust.


00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:03.660
So a producer gets their coffee and then it says 11.5%


00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.940
I'm golden, they put it on a container ship,


00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:09.540
it's not a permanent crust, that starts to migrate out.


00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.620
And then when the coffee arrives, it's at 13.


00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.740
And then they say, this is not what I ordered.


00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.060
- What do you think of the opposite?


00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:19.900
- No.


00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.740
- What do you think?


00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:21.560
- Because they're on?


00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.100
- Yeah, it's like, I don't know,


00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:40.260
[ Inaudible ]


00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:45.840
>> Something that can happen in the container, I mean, we saw a metal container.


00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.780
>> To get dry.


00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:52.920
>> Yeah. We saw if you're on a metal container, like, you can get very hot.


00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.920
And so yes, you could.


00:24:54.920 --> 00:25:00.920
Also the thing is, again, it depends on what is your route,


00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.920
what is your final destination.


00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.920
For example, what we just heard, on the ship Ethiopia,


00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:12.920
Netherlands, back in days it had to stop like four times in the different ports.


00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.920
And then it depends on where you can sit on the ship and in the port.


00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.920
So if you're in the middle or in the bottom, you probably will be good.


00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.560
But if you're like in Egypt and Cairo,


00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.440
with like 45 degree outside,


00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.760
and you're containing the coffee seed like on a really tough,


00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.000
you might get a bit gross at coffee when you realize.


00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.960
- Yeah, because what I saw in France,


00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.920
when they are like shipping the containers,


00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.840
a lot of these devices were taken to track


00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.480
the moisture, temperature, and how was it behaving


00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.320
- Yeah.


00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.160
- during the...


00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.600
- But it depends, I think, how...


00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.760
- I mean, I'm shocked that that's not done with coffee.


00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.760
It's crazy that it's not standard practices.


00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.760
Like, you can put your coffee on a container, which you were saying,


00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:04.760
it can stop four times and fourths, be on the top level in this metal box, melting,


00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:09.760
and exporters and importers are not putting in temperature tracking devices.


00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.760
Coffee just arrives, and a lot of times the producer gets blamed for shipping not what was supposed to be there,


00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.760
not considering the route that the coffee had to take. It's bonkers.


00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:24.320
Do importers and exporters have any say on where on the ship something goes?


00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.320
Or can you pay more for it?


00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.320
Like, I want this.


00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.320
No, no, no.


00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.320
This is a sub-famous coffee that she sells.


00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.320
It's like Big Mafia.


00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.320
There is like three international companies on the ship.


00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.320
Oh, I don't know.


00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.320
98% of the transportation.


00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.320
No, he said in Kenya.


00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.320
Not the Mansiun coffee in India.


00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.320
in India.


00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.320
- Maybe that's it.


00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.640
I'll look it up.


00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.640
- Okay.


00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.640
But that's still during the processing.


00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.640
It's not after it's dried.


00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.640
- No, no, this is unroofed.


00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.640
- Oh, I've never heard of this.


00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.640
- So you can use the bean, cracked is an indicator that it's too hot.


00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.640
- Being a parchment?


00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.640
- Yeah, if it starts to split, you know, you need to cover or reduce the heat or...


00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.640
It's a good indicator, yeah?


00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.640
- I think it depends.


00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.640
I mean, I don't know.


00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.640
I mean, I don't know if it's a good indicator.


00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.640
I mean, I don't know if it's a good indicator.


00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.640
I mean, I don't know if it's a good indicator.


00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.640
I mean, I don't know if it's a good indicator.


00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.640
indicator that it's too hot.


00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.640
You mean the parchment?


00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.640
Yeah, if it starts to split, you know you need to cover or reduce the heat or...


00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.640
It's a good indicator, yeah?


00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.640
It depends. I think that I've seen it both ways.


00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:24.640
So we're talking about when you see the parchment kind of split open and crack.


00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.640
It could be that we know that water expands if it's heated way too much and too quickly.


00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.640
It could be that the inner seed expands and cracks the parchment.


00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.080
But I think it could also be like a nutrient deficiency,


00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.440
something in the field where the parchment just didn't get very thick.


00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.440
Do you have some insight?


00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:43.080
I think it's because the parchment will dehydrate a lot quicker than the coffee


00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:48.120
seed. And so the parchment is trying to shrink from being dehydrated,


00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.240
but the seed is still the same size. The seed isn't shrinking with it.


00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.600
And so it's like suddenly the parchment is two sizes too small.


00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.200
I think that's, yeah.


00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.760
But that's not good for the coffee.


00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.600
It's not good for the coffee, no.


00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.960
So that's part of that rest and that gentleness.


00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.000
Like I think we could be a lot more gentle with our drying.


00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.840
- But having said that,


00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.000
when I first take it off after washing,


00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.520
I find the more you do better until it's dry touch.


00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.200
Once it's dry touch, cover it big time.


00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.040
- Yes, exactly.


00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.560
- Don't let it go one second past dry touch.


00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:28.320
- Exactly, because it's, well, you're very strict.


00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.120
I want you to like relax a little bit.


00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.360
(laughing)


00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.500
- Yeah, so getting it dry with water,


00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.640
like just that, when you wash it,


00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.560
that touch dry, that free water,


00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.920
yes, do that as quickly as possible.


00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.760
And we did that, we put it in full midday sun here,


00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.520
trying to dry it to the touch.


00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.640
But you're right, once it is dry to the touch,


00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.920
you have this disparity,


00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.560
you have these two different tissues


00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.240
that are gonna dry out at different times.


00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.560
And if you don't give it that rest,


00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.680
then you crack your parchment,


00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.680
And once your parchment is cracked, that really affects your longevity.


00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.680
You don't have that protected layer for the next six months.


00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.680
Yeah, absolutely.


00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:13.680
So would a cracked parchment sometimes be a potential indicator of uneven drying,


00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.680
or at least that the moisture might be trapped in the inside?


00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.680
I think so.


00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.680
Or just that maybe it was a little too strong in the beginning?


00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.680
No.


00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:36.180
In this case, like stations, you see it a lot when producers or stations or exporters try to try the first year to make a washed coffee.


00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.180
This we actually saw this year from Dalvik's coffee.


00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:49.180
So he just built his washing station and I mean like Pernod Gros was completely like super dirty and ruined because they didn't really calibrate it.


00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:52.860
But anyway, so they just place it on the beds straight away


00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.940
and you can see how cracked the parchment is


00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.500
because they didn't have, on that specific station,


00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.780
they didn't have any shade at all.


00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.380
So I mean, it's not really great also for the naturals,


00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.020
but for the wasps, it's not crucial since it's like.


00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.940
- Yeah, that's a good point.


00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:09.700
So if they were only used to doing cherries


00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.220
when you have so many protective layers


00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.900
and the cherries need so much more moisture


00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.580
and take longer to dry,


00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.180
and then treating your parchment exactly like your cherry,


00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.180
they were cracking those tissues.


00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.380
- Also, the mucilager, like on the EcoPulp,


00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.340
that really wrecks your parchment.


00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.180
- Yeah.


00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.500
- 'Cause it's like, just really trying


00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.620
to get the mucilage off,


00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.660
and your parchment is thin and useless.


00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.660
- Yeah, I really agree.


00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.380
So a lot of times, when people learn that,


00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.340
when I show them like all of the tissue layers,


00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.860
and say what you really want is to get into your seed,


00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.220
and you wanna remove these layers,


00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.780
and we talk about these multi-step,


00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.620
of what if I just run it through my EcoPulp,


00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.980
or remove the mucilage, and then soak it


00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.140
in something.


00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:51.140
And for me, it's like, yes, that's creative.


00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.780
But you beat up your coffee so much


00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.700
that I think what you gain in complexity,


00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:00.980
you are reducing in just sheer force


00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.420
and shattering your coffee and making it.


00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:07.500
So I wouldn't do that.


00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.780
But if we could find a more gentle-- like your enzymes


00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:12.020
that you mentioned, maybe the citric acid,


00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.620
a gentler way to remove the mucilage


00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.340
and then soak the coffee.


00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:20.860
Maybe does, like if you have the option of drying


00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:23.760
where maybe mold isn't a danger,


00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.940
having that mucilage on there


00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:28.500
might not be so bad of an idea.


00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.380
'Cause that mucilage will kind of coat your parchment


00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.220
and glue it together a little bit


00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:37.460
and also protect it from too quick of drying.


00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.780
'Cause it adds, so instead of your mucilage


00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:40.820
being like a fishnet,


00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.460
your mucilage is more like a plastic cup, you know,


00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.140
so it slows down the drying a little bit.


00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:52.460
So we notice with honeys and stuff, sometimes we get slower drying times, but also more


00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.460
even drying.


00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.740
We can tell when we roast it.


00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:56.740
It's easy.


00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:03.580
The roasting, you can see a lot of times when the drying is even or uneven.


00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:07.820
So if we're done with our fermentation and there's still mucilage, we'll just dry it


00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.540
because we want that.


00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:11.540
There's nothing wrong with mucilage.


00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:18.540
For us, honey coffee is much harder to scoop.


00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:24.540
So I like that, as a producer, to say you're doing a honey process to protect your drying


00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:28.540
and not necessarily to get some sweetness or something like that.


00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:33.540
It's being able to look at these tools and saying what you're using it for.


00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:38.540
So you're not doing it for your competition lot or to put something interesting on the label.


00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:46.540
So a lot of the benefit from the honey could be not the fermentation but the protective


00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.540
nature.


00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.540
It's pretty cool.


00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:49.540
Can I also have a question?


00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:50.540
Yeah.


00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.540
What do you think about removing the parchment from lower altitude and higher altitude?


00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.540
If you're on the lower altitude, you have parchment, but if you're on the higher altitude,


00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:53.540
you have more humidity and they don't get as strong?


00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.540
I've never seen it work well.


00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:55.540
We always had a problem with the parchment.


00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:56.540
We had a problem with the parchment.


00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:57.540
We had a problem with the parchment.


00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:58.540
We had a problem with the parchment.


00:32:58.540 --> 00:32:59.540
We had a problem with the parchment.


00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:00.540
We had a problem with the parchment.


00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:01.540
We had a problem with the parchment.


00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.540
We had a problem with the parchment.


00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:03.540
We had a problem with the parchment.


00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.540
We had a problem with the parchment.


00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:05.540
We had a problem with the parchment.


00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:10.540
I've never seen it work well. We always want to take coffee lower because of the heat.


00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:21.540
Yeah, it's good. But for example, there was one guy in Ecuador and he needed coffee from his farm in New York.


00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:28.540
He couldn't because he was too high and he was super drunk.


00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.540
So it's able to dry it, you know.


00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:32.540
Great.


00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.540
But like the air pressure doesn't make sense.


00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:39.540
Is there like anything that could be like that in this situation?


00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:45.540
No, my only consideration like if it was at the lower elevation just too humid and you


00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:51.540
had trouble and then you took it higher elevation, drier air and I mean that I've never, not


00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:56.540
never, if that makes sense, but like I've never worked with anyone that needed to do


00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:00.340
that, they had to take it higher, and you usually have to take it lower. But if this


00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:04.340
works for him because the air has less moisture and he's able to dry it, my only


00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:09.380
consideration is like that cost of transporting multiple times. And again,


00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:13.420
every time we're moving the coffee is an opportunity to physically damage it. So


00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:19.020
the more steps that a coffee has, those are more like touch points for potential


00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.620
damage. I don't know how big the lot is. It could be...


00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:22.620
Small.


00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:26.020
Right, so if it was a larger lot and you're putting it on a truck and you have all


00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:30.820
that pressure and you're driving it on these bumpy roads for whatever, five hours to get


00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:36.540
there, unloading the coffee, loading it back up, like, I think what you could potentially


00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:42.060
gain from better drying, you might lose again in like beating up your coffee.


00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.060
Yeah?


00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.060
>> [INDISTINCT]


00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:45.060
>> Okay.


00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:46.060
So, I'm going to go back to you.


00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.060
>> Okay.


00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.060
>> [INDISTINCT]


00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:52.540
[INAUDIBLE]


00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:53.540
I'll get back to you.


00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.040
OK.


00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:54.540
[LAUGHTER]


00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.540
I'll get back to you.


00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:57.900
So I just wanted to show you guys


00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.100
how difficult it was to dry the coffee that we


00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:00.940
tried on Wednesdays.


00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.220
It was drying at our house.


00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.140
These were the vents.


00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.260
And one of the things that I-- and so because it was just


00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:11.540
wet, it took us like seven weeks to dry this coffee


00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.540
at our house.


00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.020
It was a long time.


00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.020
It was a lot of effort.


00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:19.020
So what we did is, I didn't have a humidity meter at the time,


00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:24.020
so I took a little corner, so this set aside corner of the bed.


00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:29.020
We weighed the coffee, and I was monitoring my drying by weight.


00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:35.020
So we started with a sample, and because we used our coffee scale,


00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:38.020
my sample couldn't be that big. I would love to do like 5 kilos.


00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.020
Like the bigger the sample, the better.


00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.000
So I'm just using weight, so it's 1900 grams,


00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.680
and then 1500, and then 1430,


00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.440
like I'm slowly losing moisture


00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:52.120
because our coffee is water and coffee matter,


00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.160
and dry matter.


00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.200
So if I'm weighing it and it's losing weight,


00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.080
it's more likely it's water than I'm losing coffee mass,


00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.880
unless I'm doing something really, really wrong.


00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:05.080
So this is just like a nice check


00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.040
because a lot of times,


00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.720
I'll let you do that.


00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:16.160
[SOUND]


00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.280
>> That is the only vehicle that we can take to our house.


00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.960
So that is like, when Nick and I go grocery shopping,


00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.400
we have to call a local to bring us down from the mountain or to take us back.


00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.560
>> Why?


00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.960
>> Because the roads are so bad that we need a large vehicle.


00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.800
>> A roof?


00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.480
>> Yes. >> Great.


00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.200
>> [LAUGH]


00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:42.360
So he's our driver for everything.


00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.520
Anyway, so we didn't have a moisture meter.


00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.080
We're using weight.


00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.760
And I've seen a lot of producers get really tripped up


00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.040
with the moisture meter.


00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.680
If they're drying their coffee and they're checking the moisture


00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.280
content, a lot of the times I think


00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.080
they falsely think that the moisture's coming back up.


00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.920
Like, you do it at night, maybe it's at 17,


00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.600
and then you check it the next morning, and it's at 19.


00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:08.040
and then they're like, "Oh my God, we brought on moisture,"


00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.440
maybe the dew, and they get really concerned,


00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.520
and then they start to over-dry their coffee,


00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:17.520
or it just creates a lot of panic and activity.


00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.720
What I think is more likely happening


00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:24.920
is that overnight, over those 17 hours,


00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.280
the moisture that was inside did come to the surface,


00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.520
and then we're able to, the rays,


00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.760
The jump in moisture content is just a good thing.


00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.920
Where a lot of the times producers are like panicked


00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.120
that they did something wrong,


00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.320
instead of no, the process is working.


00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.400
So I like to tell them just use the weight


00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.080
and if your weight is dropping,


00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.080
even if your moisture content went up, trust your weight.


00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:51.040
Like a scale is a very solid instrument


00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:56.040
because these moisture humidity meters


00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.320
can get out of calibration very easily, very quickly.


00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:04.320
So to trust this number and then make a decision on this number.


00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.320
So one of the things that happened in the farm that I was at is they kept saying this.


00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:12.320
At night it would be low and then the next day or the next measurement would be high.


00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.320
So they were like, "Okay, we're screwing up."


00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.320
So what they did with their tunnels is they completely covered them in plastic


00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:22.320
and then underneath the tunnel, like a parabolic tunnel,


00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.320
underneath they hooked it up with light bulbs


00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:31.760
So that during the night they could heat the coffee and avoid yeah, exactly. I saw this and I was like, oh no


00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:38.320
So they were they put light bulbs underneath so that again expensive because it's electricity it took them


00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.680
time to like create these structures and


00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:46.940
Then they were making the coffee quality worse because they just wanted to see that number drop


00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.040
And so when I had them use a scale it was like


00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:56.600
They were fine. Like it was what you wanted to have it. So be careful of your of your instruments


00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.160
Can you is there a calculation you can do with?


00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.680
Initial weight to there to like actually get a percentage


00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:11.480
So in our cherry we're mostly water right because we still have all of that other tissue there


00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:15.520
We have the best when we get to parchment and we're just dry from the touch


00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:20.480
It's a guess that we're about 45% water to dry matter


00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:26.560
this is just like a general like it'll depend on your variety but it's a pretty good starting point


00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:36.480
so if i know like masomenos if i know about my water i'm starting with like here super wet coffee


00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:41.600
that i let just dry to the touch and i'm assuming that's 45 and then i just want to know how much


00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:47.680
dry batter so 1914 was just the sample that was able to fit on my scale because it was a coffee


00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:52.200
scale so I couldn't get quite two kilos. So that's just what I started with


00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:57.040
multiplying by my dry matter. So I know that about a thousand


00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:03.400
grams is dry coffee but I don't want 0% moisture. I don't want to get all the way


00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:10.660
down there. That's dangerous and undesirable. So I add back about 12%. So


00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:15.280
these are all approximations. So I'm adding back 12-ish so I know what I


00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.640
I don't want to go below.


00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.920
I know that I want to keep it--


00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.240
I'm starting at 1,900.


00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:23.000
I don't want to get below 1,178, because then I'm


00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.040
going to get too dry and potentially have other issues.


00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:30.440
So if I take my starting weight and I remove my coffee weight,


00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:36.200
I know that I want to lose 800 grams, mostly water.


00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.520
So we did this.


00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.520
And because I didn't have a moisture meter at the time,


00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.840
once a week, we would go to the co-op in San Juanio,


00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:47.640
we're just kind of check to see how we were going along because it's not again


00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:54.720
We're just kind of guessing in general like directional and then checking because that was free with this instrument


00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:01.380
Well, that's a thousand dollars. The other one is 250. So these are super accessible, but not that


00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:06.560
Not that accurate this one's better but it's more expensive


00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:10.840
You producers who have this piece of equipment?


00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.840
That's the one they had up at the farm, right?


00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.840
Is that one?


00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.840
Yeah.


00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:15.840
Yes.


00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.840
And do you know?


00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:23.840
So do they do that because milling and roasting themselves, is it as important even though?


00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:31.840
Like, or if they're going to roast right away, does the good accuracy of that matter as much?


00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.840
It doesn't.


00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.840
You're right, because they are roasting their own coffee.


00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:38.840
So this is a measurement for longevity and stability when you're going to send your coffee


00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.840
far away.


00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:44.240
If you're going to roast your own coffee, it also matters if as a producer you're getting


00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.240
paid.


00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:50.160
The more water you have, like if you sell coffee at 13%, you're selling more water,


00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.160
more weight, you get more money.


00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:58.240
If you dry that coffee down to 11, then you make less money as a producer because you're


00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.120
being, you're selling by weight.


00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.720
So there's this tension between producers want to sell coffee as wet as possible because


00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:10.440
you make more money but that puts it in risk of mold and damage and long-term


00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.440
storage. You have experience.


00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.440
I have. We had one.


00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.440
No, I mean, I don't know.


00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:20.440
This is a black lady, a Czech lady. She's working in Nicaragua.


00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.440
We work with her as well and she also exports coffee in the United States.


00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:30.440
And she has a client who requires her to dry the coffee to 9.5%


00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:34.940
And I was telling her that she's basically losing a lot of money.


00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:35.940
She's losing a lot of money.


00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:44.940
And she was like, yeah, but our clients, like, she had this completely that way because they believe that they receive very good quality


00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.940
and they're not afraid that they'll go out, whatever.


00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:56.940
Yeah, and then, you know, you are literally talking about how you can try to perceive the quality for a longer term.


00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:57.940
Yeah.


00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:01.940
Yeah, and the customer obviously doesn't have the information,


00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:06.020
and they are directly saying what they should do.


00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:06.860
Yeah.


00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:13.820
I mean, that is really shameful, that a customer is saying,


00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.020
dry the coffee this much, because not only are they


00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:21.260
paying less for it, because they are taking away


00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.260
that opportunity for water, which the standard is 11 and 1/2.


00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:28.400
So to ask for 2% less is a lot of weight, a lot of money


00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.800
that the producer is losing.


00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.560
And we do want moisture.


00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:37.480
The roaster reactions need water to bring out these flavors.


00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:42.000
So drying too low is also not a good idea for either of them.


00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.480
[INAUDIBLE]


00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.720
But I wanted to ask, do you know, for example,


00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:49.560
in the pubs, they have to do recalibration for free?


00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.480
Or is there any options here in Columbia?


00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:57.240
Because I saw often that people have the meter just


00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:57.740
[INAUDIBLE]


00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.540
Yeah, they don't know how to calibrate it.


00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.040
Exactly.


00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.640
And then it gets too expensive, and you stop using it.


00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.840
No, 100%.


00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.400
So it's like I mentioned earlier.


00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.080
Don't have a pH meter if you're not going to have buffers.


00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.680
A pH meter without buffers is worthless.


00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.440
This instrument without the moisture--


00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.440
this guy-- the humidity meter without--


00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:23.120
without calibration is also pretty pointless and can send you in the wrong


00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:27.720
direction doing a bunch of extra work that is unnecessary. So at least here in


00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:32.720
in the co-op that we were in San Juario, they give out moisture so like this is a


00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:36.880
12% sample so you go back to your machine. So it may not be the most


00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:44.680
accurate but at least you're calibrated to the co-op and then when you're


00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:49.320
selling your coffee, you at least be calibrated with them. So I'm not saying


00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.720
even their samples are the most accurate, but at least you can sort of be talking


00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:58.680
the same language. So when we got our moisture meter, we get samples from


00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:05.640
them every couple of weeks and then we check and then we're calibrated to that.


00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:11.280
So the sample that you did by mass, is that a sample you just keep in that smaller


00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:19.200
container, does it dry at the same rate? It doesn't because by being isolated it was like in a little


00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.520
thinner layer so it's still a guide. You still have to do your best to try and make it in the


00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:27.920
same conditions but I don't think that it is in the same conditions and that's small. The same


00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:32.000
thing with our bucket. There's always a problem when you're looking at a small sample of something


00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.160
and then trying to say something about a bigger sample. All I can say is this sample is at that


00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:41.800
that percent, but it was right next to the other coffee.


00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:45.280
So again, it's like, how comfortable do you feel?


00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.600
Like that's for everyone to have their own level of like,


00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.680
I feel pretty good, or I don't feel that confident


00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.240
if I didn't do something else.


00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:55.800
So yeah, small scale to full scale is always a challenge.


00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.480
But again, this was a guide and it's mostly


00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:01.160
to show producers like, don't think that you're increasing,


00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.840
you may not be increasing moisture,


00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.320
you may not have the problem that you think you have.


00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.660
And don't try to solve something


00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:09.660
that is actually not a problem.


00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:13.820
So for that, we did--


00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:14.860
so we just guessed.


00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:18.300
If I'm starting at around 45%, this is my day,


00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.940
this is my dates, my sample at 1914,


00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:25.100
guessing 45%, my dry coffee mass,


00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.460
and then what my water was.


00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:28.820
So we were just tracking it every day, trying to see,


00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:34.140
make sure that the curve was downward, just losing water.


00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:36.220
That was my goal.


00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:41.020
and to eventually get down to 11.7.


00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:45.460
And we had, in general, a downward trend.


00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:48.780
And we had this bump up in these days, 20, 21, and then 25,


00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.900
or 26, where we actually went back up.


00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.340
So in those situations, I do think


00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:58.460
we were taking on more moisture from the environment.


00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:03.100
I think that, especially as we get more dry,


00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:05.180
we're putting more energy to remove this water.


00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:06.560
I think it's kind of like a rubber band,


00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.780
like you're kind of snapping it,


00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:08.940
and it's a little bit more greedy,


00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:11.220
like if there is a lot of moisture in the air,


00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.300
to kind of take it back up again.


00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.500
So, in this situation,


00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.780
it is possible that your coffee can re-humidify,


00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.140
I just don't think it's as common


00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.700
as most producers think that it is.


00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.100
- So, no matter the humidity,


00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:26.500
you can eventually lose all that moisture?


00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:27.860
It just takes longer?


00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:30.580
Or is there like an equilibrium where it just--


00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:32.420
- There's definitely an equilibrium


00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:37.220
when you can't, like if you're at 100% humidity in your air,


00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:41.260
even with time and heat, there's still that tendency.


00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.660
So yes, it does get very difficult.


00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.940
There's some coffees that just don't go below 14


00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:47.260
and you have to take them somewhere else.


00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:48.980
They can hit that limit.


00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.020
- I've found that the drier the coffee gets,


00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:52.540
the harder it is to dry it.


00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:53.380
- Yes.


00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:56.260
It wants to hold on to that water at the end,


00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.100
more and more and more.


00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:01.380
- The last two, three, after 13%,


00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:04.020
to get to 311, it's like you have to struggle.


00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:04.860
- Yes, exactly.


00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.820
The first 15% are easy, and then the last


00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:09.180
are just holding on tight.


00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:13.180
Which is why people then want to put it in the machine


00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:15.840
'cause they get impatient, and then you did all


00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.940
of that beautiful work, and then with that impatience,


00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:19.780
you can really damage it.


00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.900
- I'll project your condition in the machine.


00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.160
(laughing)


00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.400
- So this is another picture of the coffee drying


00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:28.240
at our house.


00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.780
We were just trying to find any bit of sun,


00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:32.740
And even this was a cloudy day.


00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.820
It took a long time, and it was very hard.


00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.820
So here you can see our little sample


00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:39.980
running in that corner.


00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.860
So again, it's like that guessing of,


00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:43.460
we were just measuring that sample,


00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:45.120
but it was right next to the other copy.


00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.060
We tried to make it a similar layer.


00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.540
But if you can get a bigger sample, it's a better--


00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:53.060
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.580
There's just some wood frame.


00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:55.900
Do we keep it separate?


00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:01.100
The same tables.


00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:02.100
Yeah, the same tables.


00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:09.460
So water activity is well-established in other foods,


00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:11.180
but very new to coffee.


00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:15.140
So it's a little bit the same story with coffee with bricks,


00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:17.500
where bricks is used in a lot of other industries.


00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.340
It's a super important measurement.


00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.140
It gives us a lot of information.


00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:22.700
And then we borrowed it to coffee,


00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:25.100
and then just kind of like bungled the whole thing.


00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.340
So I think water activity is a similar thing,


00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:30.300
or we are borrowing it from another industry,


00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.220
we don't really understand it.


00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:34.700
And then we're kind of like bungling it up


00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.900
in terms of copy, like making guidelines


00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:39.420
that we don't have a lot of foundation for.


00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:44.860
So it is important because it's why food gets mold and spoiled.


00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.860
It lets us know--


00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:48.780
it gives us an idea about predicting shelf life,


00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:50.320
how long this is going to last, which


00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:55.020
is important for exporters and importers and roasters.


00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:57.020
So yeah, avoiding premature decline.


00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.740
But the water migration is not fully understood.


00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:03.420
We've already talked about this moving target.


00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.820
So we know that the sea is porous.


00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:08.580
We know there's some capillary action.


00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:13.100
We know that it could be caused by liquid diffusion.


00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:14.620
It's not one mechanism.


00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.580
There's a lot of things working together


00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:20.220
for this water, which, again, makes it difficult at the end.


00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.020
Some water is more tightly bound.


00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.980
Some water is more free.


00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:28.100
So this is just to tell you that water activity is still


00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.100
in development in terms of its usefulness for coffee.


00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:39.940
And water is important for both of these things,


00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.220
for biological activity, right?


00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:44.020
Organism growth, like we need water


00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:48.260
to create these reactions, like mold and fade.


00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:50.820
But chemical reactions need water too.


00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:54.820
So even if you have a completely sterile environment


00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:56.900
and there's no more microbes present,


00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.980
you can still have chemical reactions


00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:03.780
that can combine and oxidize and have different flavor


00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:04.780
components.


00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:09.740
So the availability of water is still really important,


00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.860
but water activity doesn't tell us the whole story.


00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:15.340
So the point of this is just to say


00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:17.820
water is important for biological and chemical


00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.460
reactions.


00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.300
And usually you don't want to have hot water.


00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:24.740
So in the way that we measure it,


00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:28.220
moisture content, our range is 10.5 to 12.


00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.140
So I'm surprised to hear this 9.5.


00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:34.580
It's even outside of the recommended bounds.


00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:37.700
And moisture content deals with how much water do we have.


00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:38.500
We have 12%.


00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:39.860
We have 10%.


00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:42.940
And water actually means, well, how much of that water


00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.460
is available?


00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:45.820
What is the energy of that water?


00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.820
What is the potential of that water?


00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:49.420
Because just because we have it doesn't


00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:52.580
mean it's readily available.


00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.220
And that scale is a 0 to 1.


00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.340
And what we want in Coffee, our recommendation is pretty broad.


00:51:58.340 --> 00:51:59.980
0.5 to 0.6.


00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:04.780
It seems small, but it's actually a pretty broad range.


00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:05.260
[INAUDIBLE]


00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:10.460
Like 6.65 or like just 60?


00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.420
Because, for example, I saw a lot of coffee


00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:21.400
[INAUDIBLE]


00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:25.380
Everything below 7, basically.


00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.380
Right, so we're going to see--


00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:28.380
we'll go here.


00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:32.860
So the thing-- yeah, is this green coffee or parchment?


00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:33.360
Green.


00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.340
Green coffee.


00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:36.340
Green.


00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:41.340
So what's important to see is that these are two water


00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:44.260
and coffee and they don't perfectly correlate.


00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:47.100
There's this curve, so where we want to be here


00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.300
is like 0.5 to 0.6 for coffee, and we can see that


00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.420
above that we have mold growth, yeast growth,


00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:55.380
we have bacteria, so we definitely want to be


00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:58.340
below seven for sure.


00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:00.940
And then like how much more, like here you can see


00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:05.280
mold growth at 0.6, so you can still have some activity.


00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:08.460
But if we go too far, like we need this amount of water


00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.700
for our browning reactions, so if we just think


00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.600
like more is better, drier is better, more stable,


00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.500
then you don't have your water available


00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:18.260
when you're, where you roast.


00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:20.980
So you definitely want to have this like balance of,


00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:22.460
I don't want so much water


00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:24.660
that I have microbial growth and mold,


00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:27.740
but I need some water so that I can have a good roast


00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:29.500
and develop my flavors.


00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:31.220
And the point is that you see this curve,


00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:34.100
it's not a linear relationship,


00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:37.860
meaning that you can have the same moisture content


00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:40.580
and two different water activities,


00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:43.420
Or-- here, I actually shot that.


00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:47.740
So this is from the Cafe Imports study of water activity.


00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:50.820
I think they were just looking at water activity for six


00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:54.020
years for a really long time, just constantly


00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:56.060
collecting this measurement of all of these copies


00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:57.100
that came to them.


00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.860
And they created this curve.


00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.340
And here are two scenarios.


00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:05.740
So we have this copy over here, that my moisture content is


00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:06.620
11.7.


00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.500
That's a good moisture content.


00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.540
That's within range.


00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:13.540
But I can have two very different water activities.


00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:16.660
This is one of the comparisons that they found.


00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.980
So out of this, I would rather have this coffee.


00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:22.060
I would rather have this moisture content


00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:27.380
and a lower water activity, just because it gives this sense


00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:29.180
of security.


00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:33.340
I have a little less potential for something to happen.


00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:38.100
But conversely, if I have a single water activity


00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:43.860
measurement, 6.61, and I have these two kind of moisture readings, this is again


00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:50.300
where a producer can lose money in terms of if they're drying more than they need


00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:57.700
to. If their coffee at 12.8 has this water activity, they can be paid for 1%


00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:03.260
more of that weight. But if you're just by drying it more, doesn't necessarily


00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:06.700
mean you're going to get lower water activity. So that's not a good


00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:11.080
correlation. So this is confusing. It's just to say it's not a good correlation.


00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:14.640
It's not a really straightforward connection and we want to like put


00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:18.520
guidelines before we've really figured this out. And one of the things that came


00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:23.260
up in the last session, Fernando was sharing that in one of the competitions


00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:28.560
is a cup of excellence. In cup of excellence he was sharing that when they


00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:34.280
receive samples, the judges or the panel is measuring the water activity and if


00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:37.320
if it's out of bounds, they reject your coffee.


00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:40.480
And they say, you can't compete or dry better.


00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:45.040
And this is also a moving target, like bricks.


00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.760
So we said bricks changes if you measure it in the day


00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:50.760
or at night, if you measure it with a full moon


00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.920
or a new moon, like bricks is a moving target


00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.000
depending on when you catch it.


00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.420
And so is water activity.


00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:59.280
Water activity will depend on when you're measuring it.


00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:02.840
So to make like a competition rule


00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:06.320
based on a moving target is really unfair.


00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:09.720
To punish producers for this thing


00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:15.040
that we don't even really understand is very coffee.


00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:19.040
But it's also really frustrating.


00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:23.040
And so this information-- so this


00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.360
is a study that Ian did for Peff Aports.


00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:30.480
So 25,000 samples, 44 different countries.


00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.880
Most of them were washed.


00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:34.320
19% of them were from Colombia, and they


00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.280
didn't do monsoon, decaffeinated,


00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.200
or robusta coffees.


00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:41.240
And these were like some of-- so this is like an 80-page report


00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:43.400
that is free on their website, and you can read it,


00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.520
and it's fantastic.


00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.760
I really recommend it.


00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.440
But the things that stuck out to me


00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:51.080
is like six years of work, 25,000 samples,


00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:54.440
and it's sort of like moisture content is


00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:57.760
neither a perfect nor terrible predictor of water activity.


00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:00.000
So this is sort of like--


00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.080
a lot of the conversation in the industry was like,


00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.960
should we ignore moisture content


00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.640
and just move to water activity?


00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:12.280
We have this romance of getting more tools and more toys.


00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.960
And this number is more accurate.


00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:16.140
This number is a better number.


00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:19.040
And his study of all these years and all these samples is,


00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.800
well, it's not a bad number, but it's not a better option.


00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.920
We shouldn't just abandon our moisture content


00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:26.040
and everybody move to water activity.


00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:29.320
we're not there yet, and it's a moving target.


00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:31.240
And one of the things we talked about in the last session,


00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:36.240
too, is that this information was collected


00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.280
after the coffee had already been shipped


00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:41.520
and arrived in the United States,


00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.080
arrived in their facilities.


00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:45.760
So we don't really know the life of that coffee


00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:46.760
or how it was dried.


00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:51.560
It would be more useful to do this analysis at origin


00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:55.120
with producers to say, to measure it several times.


00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.760
So exactly like we did with pH, I'm


00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:01.320
not going to say pH 4 is better or 4.5.


00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.680
I want to know the change.


00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:03.760
I want to know my curve.


00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:06.240
I want to know where I started and where I ended up.


00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:09.760
And water activity could be way more useful in that sense,


00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:12.760
seeing several data points over the life of the coffee,


00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:16.120
not one data point when it gets to its destination.


00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.880
And then we make a decision about it,


00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:21.760
or we punish producers for doing a bad job because their water


00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.200
activity is high.


00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.000
or telling them to change something.


00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.320
- What would it be?


00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:28.140
- Water?


00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:30.720
- Water, water activity?


00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.680
You're talking about like ideally measuring it


00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:36.060
over the shelf life of the coffee?


00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:37.480
- Or while it's being produced.


00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:40.040
So like let's measure the water activity


00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.740
right now when it gets off of the bed.


00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:43.140
And to say like, well what is it?


00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:44.720
Maybe it's at .9.


00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:49.120
And then measuring it like during its life stage of drying.


00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.580
To get to a final number at the end of drying.


00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:53.080
And then maybe to see how much it changes


00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:56.100
when it's on the container ship, if it takes six months


00:58:56.100 --> 00:59:00.380
and it's at the top container in a very hot route


00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:02.680
or if it's in the bottom or something like that.


00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:06.520
It's just so incomplete, we have so little data,


00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:08.300
but coffee's ready to put mandates


00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:10.820
and say producers can't compete or this coffee's bad


00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:12.420
or you need to change something.


00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:14.800
We just don't have enough information.


00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:19.700
- Any water, I think the measurements that are taken


00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:25.480
during green storage, post-receiving,


00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:29.560
would that fluctuate based on environmental factors as well?


00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:30.600
- I think so.


00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.120
I think it definitely could.


00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.400
- So at that point, it's like the roaster


00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.520
or the importer's--


00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:37.360
- Responsibility.


00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:38.760
- Responsibility.


00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.080
- Yeah, potential.


00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:42.080
- So the day of point, the moving target


00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:44.580
is important before that point, after that point,


00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:49.580
the producer and the exporter really have nothing,


00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:56.000
The moving target importance for a producer's standpoint is before it goes on the container.


00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Well, I mean it matters to both of them.


00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Because again, if we're going to start...


01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Something that we could see potentially is deciding to pay more or less for a coffee based on this number.


01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
So thinking that a lower number would be a more stable coffee


01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:20.000
and saying, "Well, I'm gonna pay a premium for copies that are more stable, because that is valuable to me."


01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Which sounds like a great idea, like to reward a producer saying, "You've created a more stable copy."


01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:34.000
But the other side of that is like, well then you necessarily are punishing someone who doesn't hit that mark.


01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
And it's not a consistent mark. We don't know if it's even that useful.


01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:48.280
So, yeah, what I'm trying to just communicate is that the trend is let's get rid of moisture


01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:52.880
content and let's focus more on water activity, which is a similar mistake that we made with


01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.040
BRICS, where we said, no, stop using your eyes to look at maturity.


01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.040
Let's use BRICS.


01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.040
Let's use numbers.


01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.040
Let's use instruments.


01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.040
Let's be advanced.


01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:05.840
And it hasn't led us in a good direction with BRICS, and I think with water activity, we


01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.040
are in danger of making the same mistakes.


01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.280
I'm not saying it's not useful.


01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:12.400
I'm saying it's not telling us what we think it's telling us.


01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.600
Yeah, the same as like, you don't do it in origin.


01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.600
You mostly do it in the consumer's country.


01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.120
You do it in the consumer countries


01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:23.920
because this instrument is so expensive.


01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.040
So a scale is like $20 to measure


01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.680
how much water you're losing.


01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.160
$250 for that instrument, which we said,


01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.160
comes out of calibration.


01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.820
It's not great, but it gives you another layer.


01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:37.080
The $1,000 one is better.


01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.400
It's a much larger sample.


01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.960
You can do parchment.


01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.640
People like it.


01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.000
And then Wateritudy's $4,000 minimum.


01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.720
This is the cheapest unit you can find that is reliable.


01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.760
They go up to $10,000.


01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.440
So no producer is going to spend that money on one tool,


01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:58.120
unless maybe you are a co-op and you're 50 producers that


01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:59.880
can use the instrument.


01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:06.880
And so it's more of a thing that importers use or roasters can afford this piece of equipment.


01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:07.880
And it's also really time consuming.


01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.880
It can take up to 20 minutes to do one sample.


01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:14.880
And if you're going to look at all of your coffees, there's a lot of barriers to using


01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.880
this piece of equipment.


01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.880
And it's sort of this idea of like, well, who can afford it?


01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:23.880
And then we're using the coffee that's already at destination.


01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:30.880
It makes me think of that, what is that joke about there's like a drunk guy under the streetlight


01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:35.880
and he's looking for his keys and someone comes to help him and he's like, "Oh, where did you lose them?"


01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.880
And he's like, "Over there." And he's like, "Well, why are you over here?"


01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.880
And he's like, "Well, this is where the light is."


01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.880
So he's looking over here where the light is, but that's not where the problem is.


01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:48.880
We do this so much. It's way more useful at Origin to give us information about how to process coffee,


01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.880
but it's not where the light is. The money is on the other side. The coffee's already gotten there.


01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.380
So it's just like, again, a very coffee thing to do.


01:02:56.380 --> 01:03:03.140
[BLANK_AUDIO]


01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:06.620
So now we're leaving that topic and we're just talking very quickly,


01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:09.040
unfortunately, about wastewater treatment.


01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:12.500
Unfortunately, because it's a really important topic, and


01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.220
it's a very impactful topic.


01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:17.740
But there's also very little information about this,


01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:19.620
why wastewater is important.


01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:24.780
And not having a huge or a very strong culture of treating coffee wastewater,


01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:28.620
because it is mostly small producers, especially here in Colombia.


01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:31.820
And as you guys already saw, there's a pulper that was pulled straight into


01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:32.460
the river.


01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:37.540
That is the standard of not necessarily thinking about the downstream


01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:42.740
effects of our actions in the mill.


01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:43.240
Question?


01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:43.740
No.


01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:44.700
OK.


01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:45.200
So--


01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.620
Frustration.


01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:49.100
The question a lot of the times is like,


01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.180
well, what's so bad about it?


01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:51.740
Like if it's gonna get diluted,


01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:55.260
if there's kind of this thinking of like,


01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:56.940
well, it's just small producers,


01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:58.180
little bits of coffee,


01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:01.080
like what I do doesn't really matter in the whole.


01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.620
When if everybody felt that way,


01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.140
we would kind of have the world that we have now.


01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.260
Like, it doesn't matter what I do.


01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.540
I'm just like one little person.


01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:11.580
But this wastewater is so toxic.


01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:14.780
Like the thing that makes our coffee taste good


01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.140
is so toxic to the environment.


01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:22.540
three main reasons. One, we, as we saw and measured, it's an anaerobic environment. There


01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:29.540
is little to no oxygen in that liquid. It's really acidic, very, very high acid, so it's


01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:34.740
corroding. And three, it still had a lot of breaks that we measured. There's a lot of


01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:41.740
sugar in this water. So, even though it's liquid, when you add it to any type of biological


01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:46.220
or any type of living environment, it's going to suck all of that oxygen and it's going


01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.900
to suffocate whatever's there.


01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:50.940
So that's where you kill plants and fish


01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:52.700
by just dumping this water.


01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:55.420
So it's very important to treat this water


01:04:55.420 --> 01:05:00.140
and to not treat it like it's just a liquid


01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:02.340
that you can get away with.


01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:06.860
So yeah, it's a very hostile environment.


01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:10.820
So we've talked a little bit about needing


01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:12.800
to treat the water and having these steps.


01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.280
Like the main things that we wanna do


01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.160
and having these levels is re-aerating,


01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:20.160
like reintroducing air into this medium


01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.000
before it can safely go on.


01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.200
So Cecil showed us all of his levels of ponds, the reeds,


01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:28.600
and then the aquatic plants, and then the fish,


01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.720
the proof of life that this very low oxygen,


01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:36.400
this anaerobic water can support life again


01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.860
and is able to be drunk.


01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.400
So, but it's still, you know, the system cleans up to 80%.


01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.780
We're still not at 100.


01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:48.960
We've reduced the toxicity significantly,


01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.460
but it can still be a problem if we don't go


01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.140
a little bit further than just like,


01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:57.060
this is just like FNC guidelines for the country.


01:05:57.060 --> 01:06:02.400
Another thing that we started to see with Caleb's example


01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.280
is with your pulp.


01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:08.280
So there's two of the main waste streams is your solids


01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:11.360
with your pulp and your husks and your liquids


01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.960
from your fermentation.


01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.480
So being able to combine them, being


01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:19.520
able to use your fermentation liquid with your solids


01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:25.120
to help start to break down and compost your solids


01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:27.840
is a good idea, combining these two things.


01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.920
One of the things that maybe, Julie, you


01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.880
can weigh in on a little bit that I see super, super common


01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:38.760
here in Colombia is taking the pulp from a pulped coffee,


01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.880
the skins, and just putting them immediately back


01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.400
into the field.


01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.240
I don't think that's a great practice.


01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.120
You still have all of that sugar.


01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.800
You have all of that charge.


01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.360
And I think in some instances, the concentration


01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:56.760
is just really high, and you could burn the coffee.


01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:01.440
Alternatively, I think you're inviting possibly more


01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:08.440
And then two, if you let it decompose for a little while and then put it out, you're


01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.440
significantly increasing your C to N ratio.


01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.440
So you want to start with a low carbon to nitrogen ratio in your organic matter.


01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.440
And just putting something with a high nitrogen ratio will actually leach nitrogen from the


01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.440
plant.


01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.440
And so like when you throw wood chips down, for example, sometimes in addition to the


01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:14.440
wood chips, you can put a little bit of sugar in there.


01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:15.440
And that's a good way to start.


01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.440
And then three, if you let it decompose for a little while and then put it out, you're


01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.440
significantly increasing your C to N ratio.


01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.440
So you want to start with a low carbon to nitrogen ratio in your organic matter.


01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.440
And just putting something with a high nitrogen ratio will actually leach nitrogen from the


01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.440
plant.


01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.440
And so like when you throw wood chips down, for example, sometimes in addition to the wood


01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:26.560
matter and just putting something with a high nitrogen ratio will actually leach nitrogen


01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:31.760
from the plant. And so like when you throw wood chips down for example, sometimes initially


01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:36.320
plants look a little bit more unhealthy, but letting it break down and mineralize a little


01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:41.600
first and letting it become plants available before putting it around the plant actually


01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:46.720
increases the nutrient availability you're getting from that product. So I definitely


01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:50.220
I think letting it break down a little bit first is way better.


01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:53.220
Right, so we're also making all the nutrients more


01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:54.420
bioavailable, right?


01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:58.420
Like, you have these big pieces, and by composting,


01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:00.420
you make them more easily digestible,


01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:02.220
like cooking your food.


01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:06.220
So I think that's a really difficult way that I--


01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:07.500
it's just a culture thing here.


01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.920
Like, even Humberto, who actually


01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:10.460
had a very healthy farm, you could


01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:11.660
see compared to his neighbors.


01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:13.860
He was showing his pictures of the leaves.


01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:15.740
That's his practice, and he's so proud of it.


01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:17.320
He's like, I don't let a day go by.


01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.620
He's like, I don't let a moment-- as soon as we bolt,


01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:21.040
we put it right back on the field.


01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.120
He's like, I wish you could just break it down a little bit more.


01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.480
And he had all of his husks from-- because he mills--


01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:32.080
he dry mills, so he has all of that carbon available.


01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:33.800
And he just keeps them separated.


01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.160
And I'm like, ooh, this is a great opportunity.


01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.640
But so again, it's hard to--


01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.440
I never give advice to anyone who doesn't ask.


01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:45.360
And he's never asked, so it's not my place.


01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:47.800
Then we had another question from Alejandra


01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.280
in the other session, and she said,


01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.840
"If I'm adding yeast, or if we're doing this lactic process


01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.380
"in our fermentation, is that going to affect


01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:57.120
"my wastewater treatment?"


01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:00.520
Because she does this process,


01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:04.440
she has the FNC tanks system,


01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:08.040
and they buy microbes, they buy like,


01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:12.500
she shared this in the group,


01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:17.280
digestion microbes so they buy these and then they add them to help break down


01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:23.200
your their waste. So I mentioned that you know it's hard to tell because anytime


01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:27.600
you're introducing a new organism it's a little bit unpredictable but I pointed


01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:33.300
out to her that in the thing that she's already buying it comes with Saccharomyces


01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:38.480
serratusii and it also has Lactobacillus already in it. So what I've seen in some


01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.720
places is that by doing this type of fermentation and inoculating or


01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:51.360
encouraging these organisms, you can buy less of your treatment organisms because we're


01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:52.800
like pre-inoculating.


01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.680
So it can be beneficial in two ways.


01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:00.400
You get more interesting complex fermentation and then downstream your wastewater is already


01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.680
inoculated and it can turn them out.


01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:08.040
So I said, I've worked in a place in El Salvador where this wasn't the intention and they told


01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.960
me like a year later, they're like, "Oh, by the way, like we don't have to buy the microbes


01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.760
anymore because they just completely changed over to like a SEMA and the


01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:22.340
Oro protocol so they were treating all of their mostly like 80% of their


01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:26.720
coffee was going through this process so they noticed a huge reduction in the


01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:31.640
microbes that they needed to purchase. So you know it's one of those things like


01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:37.280
if you're already buying microbes to decompose your pulp, if you just like go a


01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:41.600
little bit earlier you can take advantage of the flavor benefits and the


01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:48.840
mechanical parts. And I said, however, with our salts solution, we are adding


01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.840
salt. Salt is inhibitory, so it could be that that could negatively impact and


01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.000
maybe she would need to add more microbes. So it's hard to say if you're


01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:03.320
gonna disrupt something, but in most of what I've seen in this system, it just


01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:06.800
helps. Like you already want these microbes to break down, so


01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.000
adding them in your fermentation tank is not going to be a problem. If you're


01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
We're already buying them here. Don't buy them twice.


01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Voice water questions?


01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Because that's it you guys. You did it.


01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
That's all I have for you.


01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Thank you.


01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:39.000
So now, we're packed.


01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Oh, have we talked about the coffee?


01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:49.400
I'll ask Nick because the coffee that's on the bed is available for you guys to take home some parchment, finish drying, and roast.


01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:56.880
But it's for Stibbs, so whoever can fill their bag full first.


01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.880
Put it in your pocket.


01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.880
But is there some question there?


01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.880
What did we talk about?


01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.880
I broke some marriage.


01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.880
One once.


01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.540
(crowd chatter)


01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:26.320
- Stickers.


01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.100
Anyone want a sticker?


01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:29.940
Anyone?


01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:32.300
- Yeah, for the stickers, maybe we can get like a sister.


01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:33.720
- Okay, I'll get a sister.


01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.760
- You're just gonna start stopping on everyone's shirt?


01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:49.000
tote bag? What's the search size? Small. Can I have the shirt?


01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I have more coffee if any were want.


01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:13.840
What's that?


01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.900
- Very good.


01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:18.220
- What's that?


01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:27.200
